This is the project site for *Who said what, when?*. Originally prepared to document
research conducted for course HIS3305 at the University of Ottawa (supervised by Chad
Gaffield), this site explains my research into what speeches from the throne indicate
about shifting government priorities between 1953 and 2015.

You can navigate through the project using the table of contents located at the beginning
and end of each page. There are also plenty of internal links—I take full advantage of
hypertext’s possibilities!—so feel free to jump around as suits you best.

For any questions or comments, please [send me an email](mailto:lucas@lucascherkewski.com).
I intend to keep working at this project beyond the course’s conclusion, so this site will
be updated over time. Once cleaned, I will also share the entire corpus and code used
to conduct this research.
