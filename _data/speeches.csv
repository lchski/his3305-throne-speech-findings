Members of the House of Commons:
It is a pleasure for me to welcome you to the opening of the twenty-second parliament. This is a time when, if peace is maintained, we have every reason to look forward to the continuing development of this prosperous and happy nation.
The coronation of our beloved Queen was an occasion for universal rejoicing. Her devotion to duty, her personal charm and her happy family life have assured Her Majesty of a warm place in the hearts of all her subjects and have strengthened
our attachment to the crown and to the traditions of our constitutional system of government.
Following the legislation enacted during the last parliament, the changes in the royal style and titles have been proclaimed by Her Majesty.
Much remains to be done before there can be a permanent and durable peace in the world. My ministers therefore consider it would be unwise for the free nations to slacken our efforts to build up and maintain the necessary strength to deter aggression and they intend to continue to work to that end.
We have every reason for satisfaction that through the use for the first time of collective police action the objective of the United Nations in Korea has been substantially achieved. The aggressors have been driven back, the fighting has ceased and an armistice has been concluded. My government earnestly hopes that a political conference will ultimately succeed in restoring peace in Korea.
Canada has continued to contribute to those international projects which will promote human welfare and thereby remove some of the causes of unrest and dislocation. You will be asked to approve further assistance for relief and rehabilitation, for technical assistance and for continued participation in the Colombo plan.
The alliance of the North Atlantic nations has been effective thus far in preventing aggression in Europe. My government continues to regard the treaty as one of the foundation stones of Canada's external policy. The formation of the air division of the Royal Canadian Air Force in Europe is now completed. The brigade group of the Canadian Army is performing its role effectively in the integrated force. Canadian naval strength is increasing.
Canada's total volume of external trade has reached record levels. But dollar shortages in many countries have persisted and continue to create problems for some of our exporters. Another commonwealth conference with respect to financial and economic matters is to be held in Australia early in the new year.
Tariff concessions negotiated at Geneva in 1947, at Annecy in 1949, at Torquay in 1950 and 1951 under the general agreement on tariffs and trade have been extended for an additional period.
My ministers are convinced that nations can best achieve economic strength and security through more liberal trade and overseas investment policies and they are continuing their efforts to bring about the progressive reduction of trade restrictions.
At home we continue to enjoy general prosperity although there are some sectors of our economy which have been faced with difficulties. Our farmers have harvested the second largest wheat crop in Canadian history. Private capital Investment has reached levels never before attained. Employment is at high levels.
While more houses are being built this year than ever before, the growing population of Canada requires a continued expansion of housing. You will be asked to consider measures to increase and broaden the supply of mortgage money so that more people with moderate incomes will be able to find facilities to assist them to build their own homes.
A bill to amend the Animal Contagious Diseases Act to provide for appropriate compensation to farmers whose hogs suffered from cholera, will be placed before you.
The scheme initiated during the last parliament for insuring boats and certain gear has recently been improved and is helping to meet the hazards of the fishing industry. My government is giving particular attention to the development of markets for our fisheries and to the encouragement of more
Speech from the Throne modern methods in the Atlantic coast fisheries, particularly in the province of Newfoundland where the methods are in the greatest need of improvement.
The strategic importance of the northern part of Canada has increased greatly in recent years. Its place in the economy of Canada is steadily growing and will continue to expand in future. You will be asked to consider a bill to change the designation and orientation of the Department of Resources and Development and to define the responsibilities of the government with respect to the affairs of the Yukon and the Northwest Territories, including the Arctic archipelago, and the welfare of the Eskimos.
You will be asked to amend the Pipe Lines Act to give the board of transport commissioners jurisdiction over all companies authorized to construct or operate interprovincial or international oil or gas pipe lines.
The New York state power authority has accepted a licence granted by the federal power commission in the United States for the development of the United States share of power in the international rapids section of the St. Lawrence river. It is hoped that litigation in the United States will not have the effect of delaying the construction of the project.
As further steps in helping to improve social welfare, co-ordinated plans for rehabilitation of disabled persons are being worked out with the provinces and a measure to facilitate the establishment nation-wide of a federal-provincial assistance program for totally disabled persons will be submitted for your consideration.
As provided by law you will be required to consider this year a complete revision of the Bank Act.
The bill for the complete revision of the Criminal Code which was not finally dealt with in the last parliament will be submitted for your consideration.
A committee of penal experts has been appointed to examine and report upon methods of parole and remission of sentences.
Other measures which will be placed before you for consideration include bills respecting the Canadian forces; the United Kingdom financial agreement; the Ontario-Manitoba boundary; the extension for another year of the emergency gold mining assistance: and bills to amend the Bank of Canada Act, the Municipal Grants Act, the Explosives Act. the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, the Customs Act, the Excise Act, the Excise Tax Act, the Atomic Energy Control Act and certain veterans legislation. Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to make provision for all essential services including our national defence and the meeting of our obligations under the United Nations Charter and the North Atlantic Treaty.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence bless your deliberations and help us to come nearer to a true and lasting peace."
2,22,2,1955-01-07,liberal,"Honourable members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
It affords me great pleasure to greet you as you resume your parliamentary duties at the beginning of this new year.
Since you last met, the people of Canada have been given an opportunity of extending once more an affectionate welcome to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother. They have also had the pleasure of greeting again the consort of our sovereign, the Duke of Edinburgh, who came to attend the British Empire and Commonwealth games held in Vancouver during the summer and to visit northern parts of Canada.
While there is hopeful evidence that the increasing strength of the free world has lessened the likelihood of aggression, the terrible destruction that war would bring to North America and indeed to all mankind has been magnified by the increase in the number and effectiveness of atomic and thermonuclear weapons and the means of delivering them.
My ministers are convinced that, while the resources of diplomacy must never be neglected in the search for peace, the efforts of the free nations in building their deterrent forces must be maintained. To this end, Canada was represented at the London and Paris conferences which formulated an alternative to the European defence community and provided for the entry of the Federal Republic of Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. You will be asked to approve the agreements reached at those meetings.
Our country continues to give full support to the United Nations. The Canadian delegation took an important part in the deliberations of the recent meeting of the general assembly in New York. It is earnestly hoped that the adoption of the resolution on disarmament introduced in the political committee by the Canadian delegation may lead to agreement on an effective system of international safeguards.	.
While no final settlement has been reached in Korea, the lessening of the threat of renewed aggression in that area has made possible the withdrawal of a substantial portion of the Canadian forces.
At the invitation of the Geneva conference Canada has accepted the heavy responsibility of serving on the armistice commissions which have been formed to supervise the restoration of peace in the associated states of Indo-China.
Last autumn our nation was the host at the annual meeting of the consultative committee of the Colombo plan. You will be asked to approve Canada's continued participation in the plan as well as in the United Nations' technical assistance program.
A meeting of commonwealth prime ministers will be held in London at the end of this month to consider a number of problems affecting the peoples of this great association of nations. My prime minister plans to attend this conference.
During the summer arrangements were completed to permit the navigational facilities of the St. Lawrence river to be enlarged and a hydroelectric project to be undertaken in the international rapids section.
Work on these two projects has already begun and my ministers are convinced the stimulus to the national economy resulting from their construction will be shared in all parts of the country.
Since you last met, Cape Breton island has been linked with the mainland by the new causeway which will be ready for service as soon as the ship canal has been bridged.
It is expected that, in the course of the coming season, the new ferry between North Sydney and Port aux Basques will be in operation and the ferry service between Yarmouth and Bar Harbor started. Construction of a new ferry to operate between Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island will be undertaken early in the present year.
To improve navigation on the Pacific coast, you will be asked to make provision at this session for the removal of Ripple Rock.
Canadians learned with deep regret of the loss of life and damage to property caused by two severe storms felt heavily in the province of Ontario and the province of Nova Scotia. An agreement has been reached with the province of Ontario to assist those persons whose homes were damaged or destroyed and assistance has been given under the Agricultural Prices Support Act to the producers of apples in Nova Scotia. You will be asked to make the necessary financial provision for these arrangements.
The Disabled Persons Act which you passed at the last session was proclaimed to come into force at the beginning of the present year. The governments of all the provinces have announced their intention to participate in implementing the program to assist those who are totally unable to care for themselves; and my ministers are now in a position to conclude the necessary federal-provincial agreements to bring this humanitarian measure into operation.
Although the national economy is in a generally healthy condition, the relatively poor wheat crop is being reflected by a small decline in the total national income. Some unemployment of a regional and seasonal nature is being experienced. To help meet this situation work on public construction projects already approved is being accelerated and you will be asked to make financial provision for construction in the programs of various departments and agencies on a scale that will make possible a substantial increase in the total expenditures for this purpose.
The government proposes to introduce legislation immediately for the amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act to provide for an increase in the duration and scale of supplementary winter benefits. It is also proposing to introduce, during the session, broader amendments designed to make unemployment insurance a more effective instrument in providing financial support to unemployed workers.
The National Housing Act, 1954, enacted early in the last session, which authorized lower downpayments and larger loans, and which enabled the chartered banks for the first time to make loans on the security of residential mortgages, has been an important factor in stimulating the construction of a record number of houses in the past year. The prospects are favourable for a high level of house building in 1955.
It is proposed to bring into general operation on the first of February the provision of the act under which loans may be made for home improvements. In accordance with an undertaking given at the last
session, this section was proclaimed for small holders under the Veterans' Land Act with effect from the first of this year.
You will be asked to consider amendments to the Railway Act relating to the elimination of level crossings. The government also hopes to lay before you during the present session a measure to consolidate the legislation affecting the Canadian National Railways.
Amendments to the Electricity and Fluid Exportation Act and a measure to control works which affect the normal flow of rivers which cross the international boundary will be proposed for the purpose of ensuring that natural resources are developed in the best interests of the Canadian public.
You will be asked to consider a measure to implement a convention between Canada and the United States relating to fisheries research on the great lakes.
You will also be asked to consider legislation to provide facilities for loans to fishermen similar to those provided to farmers by the Farm Improvement Loans Act.
The government will submit amendments to the War Veterans Allowance Act to raise the basic rates as well as the ceiling on permissible incomes of recipients of allowances.
You will also be asked to consider amendments to the Blind Persons Act, to lower the age of eligibility and raise the income ceilings.
A measure which will provide for amendments to the National Defence Act and the Defence Services Pension Act will be placed before you.
Legislation will be proposed to replace the Meat and Canned Foods Act by measures to provide for the inspection of meat and for the establishment of standards for all agricultural products.
You will be asked to approve a convention signed by the members of the international civil aviation organization which fixes the responsibility for damage caused to third parties by foreign aircraft.
A joint committee of both houses will be proposed to examine, in the light of the Municipal Grants Act and possible amendments thereto, the financial and other relationships of the government and the federal district commission with the city of Ottawa and neighbouring municipalities.
Among other measures you will be asked to consider amendments to the Defence Production Act, the Government Employees Compensation Act, the Financial Administration Act, the Public Service Superannuation Act, the Historic Sites and Monuments Act, the Radio Act, the Territorial Lands Act, the Library of Parliament Act, the Canada Grain Act, the Northwest Territories Act, the Yukon Act, the Canada Shipping Act, the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act and to the Municipal Grants Act.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to make provision for the public service for the next fiscal year.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I pray that Divine Providence may guide you in the discharge of your responsibilities."
3,22,3,1956-01-11,liberal,"Members of the House of Commons:
It is with pleasure that I greet you as you resume your parliamentary duties at the beginning of this new year.
Since you last met there have been significant international developments. Some of them have been welcome as releasing tensions in certain parts of the world while others unfortunately have had the contrary effect. My ministers remain convinced of the need to maintain the defences of the free nations as a deterrent to war. A strong North Atlantic Treaty Organization and adequate protection for this continent are in their view fundamental to the preservation of peace and the security of Canada.
Security, however, cannot rest on arms alone. The government, therefore, is continuing its constant efforts, through diplomacy and negotiation and through the United Nations and other international agencies, to bring about better understanding between nations.
A meeting of commonwealth prime ministers will be held in London in June to consider matters of mutual interest. My prime minister has accepted the invitation to attend.
Meanwhile my ministers are looking forward to the visit to Ottawa in February of the prime minister and the foreign secretary of the United Kingdom.
The annual meeting of the consultative committee of the Colombo plan agreed that this constructive work should be continued for a further period and you will be asked to authorize Canada's continued participation in the plan, as well as in the United Nations technical assistance program.
A royal commission has been appointed to consider and report upon the development and financing of television and sound broadcasting in Canada.
The royal commission to examine and report upon our economic prospects is proceeding with its inquiry.
The year just ended has been the most productive in our nation's history. More men and women have been employed than ever before. Our harvests have been abundant. Our trade has exceeded all earlier levels. A record number of houses has been built.
Canada has enjoyed, on the whole, a high level of prosperity. Some sectors of the economy have not fully participated in this increased well-being. In particular, although sales of wheat in the past five years have been at record levels, an unprecedented series of bumper harvests has made necessary the storage of abnormal stocks of grain both in elevators and on farms. Lack of space in elevators has limited the ability of producers to deliver grain as early as usual in the marketing year. In order to provide an immediate source of funds where they may be needed, my ministers will ask you to authorize guarantees for bank loans to producers secured by their grain.
You will also be asked to authorize the treasury to bear the cost from August 1, 1955 of storage and interest charges on wheat held by the wheat board over and above its normal carryover levels. As a consequence of this arrangement, returns to producers will not be depressed by carrying costs on abnormal carryover.
A higher level of employment this winter than last seems to be assured and the improvements you made to the Unemployment Insurance Act last year will provide a better coverage for those who are temporarily without work, particularly in the winter season. Various departments and agencies of government have sought to arrange their construction programs to provide more employment during the winter season. It is gratifying to note that many other employers are endeavouring to follow the same policy.
In October my ministers held a conference in Ottawa with the premiers and other ministers of all the provinces to consider financial and other relations between the federal and provincial governments. Following this useful discussion and some further correspondence, my ministers have placed before all provincial governments a specific proposal for federal-provincial fiscal arrangements to commence next year.
The conference established a committee of ministers from all governments to consider health insurance programs and the work of this committee is now under way.
My ministers have also conferred with provincial ministers to consider and develop an arrangement for sharing the costs of assistance to unemployed persons not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits, and in need. Detailed agreements have been submitted to the provinces. You will be asked to approve the legislation necessary to implement this program.
You will be asked to provide for the construction, jointly with the government of Ontario, of a gas pipe line across northern Ontario from the Manitoba boundary to Kapuskasing, to be leased to Trans-Canada Pipe Lines Limited, which is to build connecting lines in western and eastern Canada. My ministers consider this government participation is necessary to make this important national project possible at this time.
You will also have laid before you amendments to the Trans-Canada Highway Act to accelerate the completion of essential links in the trans-Canada highway and to continue, in co-operation with provincial governments, the work of constructing that highway up to the agreed standards.
Amendments to the National Housing Act will be laid before you. The rapid growth of our centres of population has been a spectacular feature of our national development since the last war. and in that growth wide use has been made of the National Housing Act by our citizens, particularly in suburban areas. One amendment now to be proposed is designed to increase assistance to encourage redevelopment of older sections of our cities to their best use.
Early last year the home improvement section of the act was proclaimed. It has contributed greatly toward the betterment of many existing houses. An amendment will be laid before you to increase the amounts of loans available for this purpose.
A joint committee of both houses will be proposed to review the progress and programs of the federal district commission in developing the national capital.
In the field of industrial development you will be asked to extend the scope of the Industrial Development Bank. You will also be asked to increase the size of loans which may be made by the Canadian farm loan board and to amend the Farm Improvement Loans Act.
My ministers also plan to introduce a bill to provide that women receive equal pay with men for equal work in industries which are under federal jurisdiction.
You will be asked to revise the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act and the Dominion Succession Duty Act. You will be requested to consider amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board Act. the Supreme Court Act, the Excise Act, the Canada Shipping Act, the Small Loans Act, the Navigable Waters Protection Act, the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act, the Prairie Farm Assistance Act, the Canadian Citizenship Act and the Indian Act.

You will also be requested to authorize the provision of relief for the victims of the recent tragic events in Hungary.

It Is again a pleasure for me to greet you as you resume your parliamentary duties in this new year.
The international scene continues to be characterized by instability in the Middle East and in eastern Europe.
My ministers remain convinced of the need to maintain the basic unity of the commonwealth and the reality of the western alliance, to contribute effectively to the supervision of the cessation of hostilities between Israel and Egypt under the authority of the United Nations and to the achievement of a lasting settlement of Middle East problems.
Visits to Canada in the last few weeks by the prime ministers of Ceylon and India have been conducive to a renewed strengthening of the bonds which unite the peoples of the commonwealth in their constant aim to co-operate in the pursuit of peace, liberty and progress.
An encouraging advance is being made, as evidenced by the latest ministerial meeting of the council, in the development of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the non-military as well as in the military field. My ministers remain strongly convinced of the need to maintain the North Atlantic treaty as the keystone of the defence of the western nations.
In the Middle East Canadian servicemen, as part of the United Nations emergency force proposed by Canada at the general assembly of the United Nations, are performing valuable tasks in the interest of world peace.
The United Nations has served to focus world opinion on the brutal repression of the heroic Hungarian people in their endeavour to throw off the yoke of Soviet imperialism. The vast humanitarian problems that have arisen as a result of Soviet intervention require the joint efforts of many countries. Through the United Nations, the Red Cross, and in co-operation with the government of Austria, this country is playing its part in relieving suffering and re-settling the refugees.
The entrance into Canada of Hungarian refugees has been greatly facilitated and free transportation provided from Austria to new homes in this country. Already thousands of these Hungarians have been welcomed to Canada and we look forward to receiving thousands more during the winter and spring. There are also substantially increasing numbers of immigrants from the British Isles arranging to proceed to Canada this year.
Recent events have confirmed my ministers' belief in the importance of seeking solutions to international problems through the United Nations
and of upholding by all practical and constructive means the principles of the United Nations charter. My ministers also believe, however, that while making every effort to achieve these long-term goals, the western nations must remain strong and united in their defences and in their diplomacy in order that aggressive action against them will be prevented and international tension can be lessened.
Excellent progress is being made in our national economic development. Expansion is evident in every part of Canada. Rapid strides are being made in opening up and utilizing our natural resources and in our industrial and urban growth. Employment has reached unprecedented levels. Once again we have been blessed with good crops. External trade was considerably greater last year than during any previous year. Canadians in almost every part of the country have been enjoying the benefits of this invigorating economic climate.
Indeed our economic expansion has been so rapid that it has put a serious strain upon the supply of various types of labour and materials needed for the many projects which are being put in hand. The corresponding competition to borrow savings to finance all these projects has brought about an increase in interest rates. Increases in the volume of money and credit have had to be carefully limited in order to check inflationary tendencies and the financial policies of my government have also been directed to counteract these same tendencies.
In the last few days a serious industrial dispute has led to a stoppage of work on one of the major railways of Canada despite the use of the normal processes of conciliation. Special efforts have been made and are continuing to be made by my ministers to assist the parties to reach an agreed settlement.
The preliminary report of the royal commission on economic prospects has been received and will shortly be laid before you.
You will be asked to approve a measure for the establishment of a Canada Council for the arts, humanities and social sciences, in order to give a new impetus to the development of Canadian scholarship and culture. In this measure you will be asked to approve an endowment for the council so that it may discharge its functions with the greatest possible sense of responsibility.
Because it is important that our universities should be able to keep pace with the increasing demands to be made upon them by the increasing number of young Canadians, you will be asked to approve a further grant of money to the Canada Council to be distributed by it for the purpose of assisting Canadian universities in some of their necessary construction projects. You will also be asked to approve the doubling of the annual grants to universities, and the payment of these funds to the national conference of Canadian universities for division by it among the recognized institutions of higher learning.
A measure will be placed before you for the purpose of renewing on a revised and increased basis the federal program of grants to provincial governments in aid of technical and vocational training.
It is proposed to recommend in the Senate the establishment of a committee to consider what should be done to make better use of land for agriculture and thus to contribute more effectively to the improvement of agricultural production and the incomes of those engaged in it.
An amendment extending the scope of the Municipal Grants Act will be laid before you to authorize the payment of grants in lieu of taxes on federal property in all municipalities where such property receives the normal municipal services.
An amendment to the Merchant Seamen Compensation Act will be presented making appropriate improvements in the scale of benefits to disabled seamen and the dependents of deceased seamen.
You will be asked to consider legislation for the implementation of a north Pacific fur seal convention.
An amendment to the Sockeye Salmon Convention Act to include pink salmon in this international agreement will also be laid before you.
You will be asked to consider a revision of the law controlling narcotic drugs in the light of the report of the Senate committee on the use of narcotics in Canada.
A bill will be introduced for the purpose of continuing the Canadian wheat board as the sole marketing agency for western wheat, oats and barley.
A measure will be laid before you to provide for the division of the national museum of Canada into two museums to be known as the Canadian museum of natural history and the Canadian museum of human history.
A revision of the Federal District Commission Act will be presented for your consideration.
Amendments of detail to a number of other acts will also be introduced.

Members of the House of Commons:
I greet you as your Queen. Together we constitute the parliament of Canada. For the first time the representatives of the people of Canada and their sovereign are here assembled on the occasion of the opening of parliament. This is for all of us a moment to remember.
Parliamentary government has been fashioned by the wisdom of many centuries. Its justice, authority and dignity are cherished by men of good will. It will be the high purpose of my ministers not only to preserve these qualities but to take steps to make both houses of this parliament more effective in the discharge of their responsibilities to the people of Canada.
You have come here to form this new parliament from across a great land, a land far wider than either of those older countries that first gave it birth. I am proud to contemplate the great heritage of this nation-the minerals, the forests, the lands, the waters, the sources of power and energy which fire your ever-growing industries. But I am more proud to contemplate the spirit and ideas which brought this country to nationhood, and now, drawing reinforcement and enrichment from many lands and peoples, have given Canada a national character peculiarly her own.
Yet in this age no nation can live unto itself. Through the overcast of international affairs the bright constellation of the commonwealth illumines our times. The continuing admission of nations newly guided to self-government both broadens and strengthens our diverse commonwealth as more of us come to share the great inheritance of those institutions and ideals which make our association a quiet but pervasive force for good in an unquiet world. This was manifest when the prime ministers of the commonwealth met in London last June to talk of great affairs; and again, only a few days ago when on Canada's invitation, the finance ministers met at Mont Tremblant and in a comradely spirit laid plans for a commonwealth trade and economic conference to take place next year.
A similar spirit has been evident in the Colombo plan, which is a part of the high venture of the peoples of south and southeast Asia as they move along the path of national development, and which my government will continue to support.
My ministers believe that Canada's active participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is essential for the preservation of peace. You will accordingly be asked to maintain modern defence forces in being which, together with those of our allies, will continue to act as a deterrent to attack upon any part of that alliance.
While Canada plays a full part in these particular associations, my ministers remain convinced that in the wider forum of the United Nations we must also continue to seek such agreements as will preserve security and bring about a wide measure of disarmament. Indeed we must continue to hope that through the United Nations the aspirations of men and women for peace and security will be fulfilled.
In domestic affairs my ministers look forward to meeting next month with the leaders of the provincial governments in order to discuss fiscal relations and to seek better understanding and arrangement of many aspects of our public finances.
In the legislative program to be laid before you, it is fitting that mention should first be made of measures to improve the lot of the senior members of our society. Accordingly you will be asked to increase old age security pensions and to shorten the period of residence required to qualify for them. Changes will be proposed in the terms of assistance offered to provincial governments to enable them to increase the payments to be made under the Old Age Assistance Act, the Blind Persons Act and the Disabled Persons Act to a corresponding level.
You will also be asked to increase the scale of war veterans allowances and to enlarge the groups to whom they are paid. Changes will also be proposed in several sections of the Pension Act.
In order to assure to the farmers of Canada a fair share of the national income, you will be asked to enact a measure to provide greater stability in the prices of their products. Every possible effort is now being made, and will continue
Address to Her Majesty to be made to seek new markets for agricultural products as well as to regain those that have been lost.
Due to inability to market their grain, prairie farmers have for some time been faced with a serious shortage of funds to meet their immediate needs. In order to permit them to receive an advance payment for the grain they can expect to deliver this year you will be asked to authorize a system of cash advances for grain stored on farms.
My government will strive to secure additional markets for the products of our fisheries and to promote the development of international rules to safeguard the living resources of the sea.
My ministers believe that a national development policy carried out in co-operation with the provinces, and in the territories, is needed to enable all regions of Canada to share in the benefits to be realized in developing the resources of this great nation. It is their intention to propose to you from time to time programs and projects to implement this policy.
As an immediate start upon a program of more extensive development in the Atlantic provinces, you will be asked to authorize, in joint action with the provincial governments, the creation of facilities for the production and transmission of cheaper electric power in those provinces. You will also be asked to provide assistance in financing the Beechwood project which has been under construction in New Brunswick.
My ministers will advance this national development policy further by initiating new discussions with the government of Saskatchewan in order to make possible the early commencement of construction of the dam on the South Saskatchewan river.
My ministers are pressing for a favourable settlement of international problems in connection with the Columbia river to clear the way for a joint program with the province of British Columbia to develop the immense power in the waters of this river.
My ministers will place before you a measure to ensure that those working in industries under federal jurisdiction will receive annual vacations with pay.
You will be asked to approve bills relating to certain railway branch lines, amendments to the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act, and, in so far as the other business before you permits, to several other statutes.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the sums required for carrying on the government of Canada during the remainder of the current fiscal year.
Changes in certain of the taxing statutes will be submitted for your approval.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the Commons:
I wish to express to you and to the people of Canada my gratitude and that of my husband for the warmth of the loyalty and affection with which we have been welcomed here in Canada.
As I now address you here for the first time, I will call to your minds the words of the earlier Elizabeth when, more than three centuries ago, she spoke from her heart to the Speaker and members of her last parliament and said ""Though God hath raised me high, yet this I count the glory of my crown, that I have reigned with your loves"". Now here in the new world I say to you that it is my wish that in the years before me I may so reign in Canada and be so remembered.
On this happy day when we give thanks to God for all that He has bestowed on us, I ask that He may bless and guide you."
7,24,1,1958-05-12,conservative,"Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
It is my pleasure to welcome you to this first session of the twenty-fourth parliament of Canada. We all recall with pleasure the historic events of last autumn when Her Gracious Majesty was present to open parliament herself and to receive the warm welcome and wide acclaim of her Canadian subjects. We look forward to the presence this summer of Her Royal Highness Princess Margaret to take part in the centennial ceremonies of British Columbia and to visit other parts of Canada.
As further evidence of the expanding sense of mutual interest among the countries of the commonwealth as well as the growth of the commonwealth itself, it is pleasing and significant that we will be welcoming to Canada this summer both the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Prime Minister of Ghana.
My ministers have been glad to note the widely expressed desire of the peoples of many nations that the manifold advances of science shall be devoted to the betterment of mankind rather than to the arts and engines of war. My government will continue to make unremitting efforts to assist in the peaceful solution of international problems and in the accomplishment by patient negotiation of a substantial measure of disarmament. In the meantime, my advisers will ask your support to maintain, in co-operation with our allies, armed forces adequate to deter any potential aggression.
My government believes that the condition of international economic affairs is such as to require major concerted efforts to encourage the expansion of trade. It is accordingly very gratifying that all countries of the commonwealth have accepted the proposal of Canada that a commonwealth trade and economic conference be held in September of this year in Montreal.
We look forward with pleasure to the visits to Canada this summer of the President of the United States and the President of the Federal Republic of Germany. My ministers welcome the opportunities which these visits will afford for useful conversations.
My government regrets to have to report that efforts to avert a strike of firemen on the Canadian Pacific Railway were unsuccessful. It is however encouraging to note that negotiations which my ministers arranged between the parties have succeeded in narrowing the issues in dispute to the point where further direct discussions may yet resolve the question. My government continues to maintain a constant watch over developments in this situation and will be ready in the light of events to recommend such action as the national interest demands and circumstances may require.
My government will propose to you the enactment of a bill of rights to safeguard the rights of all persons in Canada in respect of all subjects within the jurisdiction of parliament.
You will be asked to approve a number of measures and appropriations to continue and extend the program of my government in sustaining employment by the acceleration of useful public works and by encouraging the development and processing of our natural resources.
You will be asked immediately to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act in order to extend for a further six weeks, during the current year, the period during which special seasonal benefits may be paid. Already the amendments to this act made in November last and those made to the Unemployment Assistance Act have proven their value in mitigating the difficulties of Canadians who are temporarily without jobs. Further amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act will be proposed at a later stage in the session.
My government will continue to promote a vigorous program of house building, which has already proven to be a strong feature of our economy and which constitutes the best opportunity for increased work in meeting the needs of our people. My ministers are ready to co-operate fully under the authority of the National Housing Act in further projects for slum clearance and urban redevelopment to improve the cities and towns of Canada.
In order to ensure the continuation of our national housing program, you will be asked at an early date to approve an increase in the public funds made available under the National Housing Act.
You will be asked to make provision for a substantial program of public investment to be carried out by government departments and crown companies and to provide assistance to provincial governments for certain agreed types of projects. In particular, a large expansion in the construction and equipment of our system of airports and airways will be proposed and an increase in our work on harbours and rivers and public buildings.
In order to promote our national development on the frontier in the north you will be asked to authorize the construction of a railway to Great Slave lake. My ministers regard this as a major step in the establishment of productive industry on an economic basis in the Northwest Territories. You will also be asked to provide for the construction of important roads needed for development in the Yukon and Northwest Territories and in the provinces, with the co-operation of their governments. You will be asked to provide for the initiation of a program of research to assist in opening up the mineral resources of our Arctic islands.
My ministers have made progress in arrangements for the construction of the South Saskatchewan project. Proposals will be placed before you to make possible the commencement, this year,
of the construction of the main dam intended to create a great reservoir in the heart of the prairie in order to further the productive development of this part of Canada.
The easing of the stringency in the capital markets of Canada during the past eight months encourages confidence in the expectation that large programs of public investment can be successfully financed not only by my government and its agencies but also by provincial governments and municipalities. My ministers remain mindful of the importance of financing their large program of expenditures in such manner as will best safeguard against a recurrence of inflationary dangers in future. They wish to urge upon all groups in our society a recognition of the dangers and inequities of inflation and the need to restrain demands which will give rise to increases in prices and the costs of production.
The improvements in our financial relations with the provinces made by the last parliament are having a beneficial effect upon our economy bymaking it possible for provincial governments and their municipalities to proceed with greater confidence upon expanded programs of necessary services and works.
There will be placed before you a proposal to establish a new agency to regulate broadcasting in Canada and to ensure that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the privately owned broadcasting stations work effectively together to constitute a national system to provide satisfactory television and radio services to all Canadians within reach. Related amendments to the Radio Act will also be proposed.
To promote and guide the proper long-term development of our national capital region upon lines worthy of our nation, my government will request you to enact a new national capital act to replace the present Federal District Commission Act.
Changes will be proposed in the Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act to make certain that payments may be made to participating provinces qualifying under the act in respect of any periods commencing after June this year.
You will be asked to authorize the establishment of a harbour commission to combine the growing harbours at Fort William and Port Arthur and to fit this lakehead harbour to handle the larger traffic to be expected as a result of the seaway.
Unremitting efforts are being made to sell Canadian agricultural and fisheries products in the markets of the world and considerably larger exports of wheat and cattle have been made. Support prices have now been established for a considerable number of products under the Agricultural Stabilization Act to carry into effect, for the current year, the desire of parliament that agriculture should be thus assisted to realize fair returns for its labour and investment.
The act to provide cash advances on farm-stored grain has proven to be of advantage to a large number of farmers and to the economy as a whole. Certain amendments will be proposed to that act in the light of experience in its application.
Amendments will also be proposed to the Prairie Farm Assistance Act and the Canadian Farm Loan Act.
In order to assist small business, there will be established a small business section within the administrative machinery of government. The functions of this organization will be to provide liaison between the government and small businesses, to study the problems of small business and to advise on measures necessary to meet them.
You will be asked to replace the present Ticket of Leave Act with a new statute to establish a national parole board. There will be submitted for 
your consideration amendments to the Citizenship Act and the Indian Act to eliminate certain discriminatory provisions in these statutes.
Amendments will be proposed to the Veterans Insurance Act, the Returned Soldiers Insurance Act, the Children of War Dead (Education Assistance) Act, the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act, the Transport Act, the National Parks Act and a number of other statutes.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on the services and payments approved by parliament.
My ministers will lay before you in accordance with the law the special warrants which I issued upon their advice to authorize expenditures urgently required for the public good during the period since the twenty-third parliament was dissolved. You will be invited to consider and approve these expenditures. An amendment to the Financial Administration Act will be proposed relating to the use of special warrants.
Other measures will be proposed to improve the effectiveness of the processes of parliament.
The government will ask your approval of the installation in the House of Commons of a system of simultaneous translation.
You will be asked to set up a select committee on broadcasting, a standing committee on estimates and a standing committee on veterans affairs, all with power to send for persons and papers. My ministers will propose that a member of Her Majesty's loyal opposition be elected chairman of the committee on public accounts.

I welcome you as you foregather to resume your parliamentary duties.
All Canadians look forward with the greatest pleasure to the forthcoming visit to Canada of Her Gracious Majesty the Queen and His Royal Highness, the Prince Philip, on the occasion of the official opening of the St. Lawrence seaway. It is particularly gratifying that Her Majesty also plans to visit all the provinces and the two territories in order to meet her Canadian subjects in many parts of our country.
Canada's close relations with the other countries of the commonwealth, and the sense of community of interest within this association of free nations itself, have been confirmed and vitalized by the recent visit of my Prime Minister to the commonwealth capitals of the United Kingdom, Pakistan, India, Ceylon, Malaya, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. These consultations between heads of government provided an opportunity for an exchange of views on international questions, on the possibilities for expanding trade and on other problems of mutual concern.
Canadians recognize that the most pressing need of all nations is an enduring peace. My government will continue to work steadfastly and in a spirit of genuine co-operation towards the settlement of outstanding issues which threaten that peace.
My ministers are concerned over recent developments in the Berlin situation. They deplore the attempt by the Soviet union to abrogate unilaterally the interallied agreements relating to Berlin, and they believe that the freedom of West Berlin must be assured pending agreement on the establishment of a united and free Germany.
My ministers have been pleased to note that some advance has been made during the past year in the vital field of disarmament. The drafting of an agreement for the discontinuance of nuclear weapons tests is a hopeful beginning.
It is Canada's desire that the scientific achievements which now have made possible the penetration of outer space should be a blessing to all mankind. My government is convinced that international agreement must be reached without delay to ensure that outer space is used only for peaceful purposes with full co-operation among all nations.
In concert with its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Canada has reaffirmed its determination to maintain and improve the power of the alliance as a deterrent against aggression. You will be asked to provide for maintaining the effective power of Canada's defence forces. The importance of the alliance was re-emphasized by the visit of my Prime Minister to the United Kingdom, France, West Germany and Italy. His consultations with the heads of government in those countries included trade and economic policies, as well as the more general questions confronting the alliance.
Discussions are taking place with the government of the United States to enable Canadian industry to share in the production of equipment being procured by the United States for joint defence purposes. [Mr. DiefenbakerJ
My ministers continue to recognize the necessity of providing economic assistance to underdeveloped nations. Approval will be sought for the appropriations needed for this purpose, so that Canada may play its full part in helping the emerging states of Asia and Africa, particularly those in the commonwealth.
My ministers expect that the increases which have been proposed in the resources of the international bank and the international monetary fund will be approved by the votes of the member countries and when that has occurred you will be asked to approve the necessary legislation to implement these important measures for improving the facilities for financing world trade and economic development.
In response to suggestions put forward by my government, a commonwealth trade and economic conference was held in Montreal last September. This meeting, one of the most important in the history of the commonwealth, was attended by ministers representing the self-governing nations of the commonwealth and the countries now looking forward to obtaining full sovereignty. A large measure of agreement was reached on trade and economic matters. This has led to far-reaching decisions on the part of the United Kingdom and other countries to restore convertibility of their currencies and to remove restrictions on imports.
My government has taken action to reduce unemployment by expediting national works programs, by programs undertaken in co-operation with the provinces, and by encouraging Canadians generally to undertake constructive activities particularly in the winter season. You will be asked to assist the municipalities of Canada in the financing of work on construction projects which would not otherwise have been undertaken during the winter months.
Certain amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act will be submitted to you.
My government welcomes the evidence of recovery from the recession and will continue to foster and assist this improvement. They believe that as recovery proceeds there will be increasing need for care to preserve the stability and purchasing power of our currency.
My government will continue in its economic policies to lay emphasis upon national development. My ministers believe that by the wise use of the resources with which nature has endowed this country, Canadians can achieve a continually rising standard of living. My government will therefore foster and encourage the proper development and use of these resources and the growth of efficient industry based upon them. Many projects for national development have already been put in hand; you will be asked to vote the supply necessary to continue these projects and to initiate others.
Additional legislation in the field of agriculture will be recommended. A measure will be laid before you to institute a system of crop insurance in co-operation with such provinces as so desire. You will also be invited to make a comprehensive review and revision of the legislation concerning farm credit, in order that credit may be more effective in assisting in the development and maintenance of an efficient and prosperous agriculture.
You will be asked to enact a bill of rights which will make manifest the intent that fundamental rights and freedoms shall prevail and remain inviolate in all matters within the competence of parliament.
At the earliest opportunity you will be invited to authorize the establishment of a national energy
board to ensure, so far as it lies within the jurisdiction of parliament, that Canada's energy resources are used effectively and prudently to the best advantage of Canadians.
My ministers have been gratified to see the alltime record in house construction which has been made possible by government loans under the National Housing Act. They will recommend to you further amendments to that act to continue this program and to encourage the flow of private funds into mortgages.
For the purpose of increasing the range and effectiveness of the guarantees provided for financing exports, you will be asked to make certain amendments to the Export Credits Insurance Act.
My government will place before you certain amendments to the laws respecting trade practices.
You will be asked to consider a bill containing numerous amendments to the Canada Shipping Act.
My government will request your approval of its participation in a contributory plan to provide medical benefits for civil servants pursuant to recommendations of the national joint council of the public service.
A comprehensive review of the provisions of the Veterans' Land Act will be proposed and amendments to ensure that veteran farmers also can take greater advantage of modern agricultural practices. Amendments to the Veterans Rehabilitation Act and the War Service Grants Act will also be recommended.
My government will recommend an amendment to the Federal-Provincial Tax-Sharing Arrangements Act to extend for another year the increase made last year in the provincial share of personal income tax revenue.
My government proposes that the entire subject of financial relations between the dominion and the provinces shall receive continued active co-operative study. All provincial governments are being asked to agree to the use, for this purpose, of the machinery of the existing federal-provincial continuing committee on fiscal and economic matters working under the direction of a committee consisting of the Minister of Finance and all provincial treasurers.
My ministers will recommend to you action to alleviate the discriminatory effects of the recent horizontal increase in freight rates.
Recommendations for a number of changes in the Criminal Code will be placed before you including some to strengthen the provisions respecting obscene literature.
My ministers will propose to you measures to revise the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act and to revise and consolidate the relevant pension provisions.
You will be asked to approve a statute to authorize the appointment of parliamentary secretaries to ministers of the crown.
My government will put forward a resolution to establish a joint committee of both houses to review the Indian Act and the administration of Indian affairs.
A recommendation will be placed before you for a statute to continue on a permanent basis the supplementary pensions for retired civil servants, members of the armed services and of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that were provided on an interim basis by an appropriation last year.
My ministers will recommend an increase in the total funds that may be expended under the Trans-Canada Highway Act.
You will be asked to revise the Seeds Act, to approve and implement by statute an agreement with the province of New Brunswick concerning Indian lands, and to extend the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act for a further three years.
You will also be asked to amend the Northwest Territories Act, the Public Lands Grants Act, the National Defence Act, the Defence Services Pension Act, the Broadcasting Act, the Public Servants Inventions Act and certain other statutes.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be invited to establish a special committee of the house to review broadcasting policy and operations.
It will be proposed that the standing committee on privileges and elections review the elections act in preparation for subsequent legislation.
It will also be proposed that the question of ensuring the use of humane methods in the slaughtering of animals be referred to the standing committee on agriculture for consideration.
You will be asked to appropriate the sums required for carrying on the government of Canada during the next fiscal year.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence bless you and guide you in your duties."
9,24,3,1960-01-15,conservative,"Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I am happy to greet you as we meet for the first time at the opening of our parliament.
My appointment as the representative of Her Majesty the Queen in Canada is an honour which moves me profoundly. I invoke divine help to
Speech from the Throne guide and strengthen me that I may serve well the parliament and people of Canada in carrying out the trust confided to me by the sovereign.
We will long cherish the memories of the presence of our gracious queen and of his royal highness among us last summer. The warmth of the welcome given them throughout the country is an expression of the loyalty, devotion and affection of all Canadians. Our attachment to the crown is a great unifying force. It will be my earnest endeavour to foster a spirit of harmony and confidence in all, irrespective of race or creed, in the achievement of our mighty destiny.
My prime minister looks forward to meeting with the leaders of the other commonwealth governments early in May. The commonwealth is in a state of rapid constitutional development. During the course of the year Nigeria is to become an independent member following those constructive processes by which the commonwealth has set a lead in peaceful evolution of new nations from dependent territories.
We welcome the spirit which has made possible the progress of the past year in meetings between the leaders of great nations and we believe that with wisdom and patience the series of meetings arranged to commence in Paris in May can bring about the results which all desire. Canada will be prepared to assist wholeheartedly by consultation, particularly in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with those immediately involved in these efforts to achieve just diplomatic settlements.
A lasting peace between nations, founded upon understanding and tolerance, is the strongest aspiration of Canadians. The government continues to regard as a primary goal the achievement of the greatest possible measure of controlled disarmament. Canada will devote every effort to discharging its responsibilities as a member of the ten nation disarmament committee. Some progress has already been made by those nations possessing nuclear weapons in preparing a treaty to discontinue the testing of such weapons and to establish a system of international control.
We are heartened by the unanimous approval given by the United Nations to the Canadian proposal to sample and analyse more widely and effectively the radioactive content of the atmosphere, soil and food. For this purpose necessary funds to enable Canada to take a leading part in this work will be requested.
It must be expected that the recent technological advances in the penetration of outer space will lead to further dramatic developments. Canada welcomes the opportunity to participate actively in the United Nations committee intended to ensure that outer space is used only for peaceful purposes.
Economic and technical assistance to the less developed nations of the world continues to be needed both on humanitarian grounds and to provide the economic basis for peaceful and orderly progress in those nations. You will therefore be asked to continue programs of aid to other, less developed nations, particularly those in the commonwealth. You will also be asked to vote support for the program of scholarships and fellowships to be exchanged within the commonwealth adopted at the suggestion of Canada.
Substantial progress has now been made in finding a satisfactory basis for the development of the power of the Columbia river in co-operation with the United States and negotiations for this purpose have now been initiated with the government of the United States. The results will be placed before parliament for approval and for the authority to take the measures necessary to bring about the full use of this most valuable source of power. The government of Canada remains ready to participate with British Columbia in the joint development of the potentials of this great river.
International trade is one of the chief bases of Canadian prosperity and must continue to be a
major interest of this parliament. The growing exports of various countries are presenting us with both increasing opportunities for trade and problems of competition. Developments of far-reaching importance to Canada's trade are now taking place in Europe, and two of my ministers are in Paris today consulting on these subjects with representatives of other nations.
Canada's general economic position has greatly improved during 1959 and the prospects for 1960 are favourable. The recurrent problem of seasonal unemployment remains, however, but apart from this, expansion in production and employment has been general across the nation.
My government is pleased that its national development program has stimulated a large increase in northern exploration. Last year's discovery of oil and gas in the Yukon is being followed this year by a score of new exploratory wells over a wide area of northern Canada. Coupled with a revival of mining activity, this makes it evident that private enterprise is now active in the opening up of the north. New oil and gas regulations will emphasize opportunities for Canadians to participate in the ownership of these northern resources.
The securing to farmers of a fair share of the national income, through the maintenance of prices of farm products, has received constant attention and continues to be a matter of prime concern to my government. Our farms have yielded surpluses which have necessitated a revision of existing measures to stabilize farm prices to ensure that their basic purpose is achieved without the wasteful accumulation of surplus stocks. The severe, unseasonal snow in the prairie provinces interrupted the harvest rendering necessary emergency legislation which will be considered at the earliest possible opportunity.
Legislation to provide for a Canadian bill of rights will be placed before you for your approval.
My ministers have had under consideration the enactment of a provision that would enable the establishment of a uniform retirement age of 75 for all judges appointed under the authority of the parliament of Canada. Agreement has now been reached with all provincial governments on this principle. You will accordingly be asked to approve a resolution leading to an appropriate amendment to the British North America Act, and you will then be asked to make consequential amendments to the Judges Act.
Bills will also be submitted for your approval to give added status and responsibility to the territorial councils of the Yukon and Northwest Territories and to improve the administration of justice in the territories.
Amendments to the Combines Investigation Act and the related provisions of the Criminal Code will be laid before you to clarify and improve this act and protect the interests of small business firms.
You will be requested to revise the Civil Service Act and a special committee of the House of Commons will be proposed for the consideration of the bill. Amendments to the Public Service Superannuation Act will also be placed before you.
An amendment will be proposed to the Federal-Provincial Tax-Sharing Arrangements Act to extend, for the two remaining fiscal years covered by that act, the increase in the share of the revenue from the personal income tax that is allocated to the provinces. You will also be asked to authorize, for any provinces which desire them, alternative arrangements in respect of university grants.
Legislation will be introduced to give Indians
the franchise in federal elections. You will be invited to re-establish the joint committee on Indian affairs.
You will be asked to authorize the establishment of a new department to be concerned with affairs relating to the forests of Canada and their most effective utilization and conservation, and to assume responsibility for other related resources.
You will be requested to extend for three years the operation of the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act.
An amendment will also be proposed to the National Energy Board Act authorizing the temporary extension of the licences for the export of electricity until the board can conclude its urgent business on export of gas.
A proposal will be placed before you to extend the period during which payments may be made in respect of construction of the trans-Canada highway. You will also be asked to continue the operation of the Export and Import Permits Act for another three years. The repeal of the Newfoundland Fisheries Board Act will be proposed.
Measures will be placed before you to amend the Old Age Security Act and the Veterans' Allowance Act to establish a basis for the payment of pensions and allowances, respectively, to Canadians residing outside Canada.
You will be asked to authorize the establishment of harbour commissions for the harbours of Nanaimo and Oshawa, and to amend the Windsor Harbour Commissioners Act.
You will also be requested to revise the Feeding Stuffs Act and to amend the National Housing Act, the Expropriation Act, the Department of Justice Act and certain other statutes.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and payments authorized by parliament. To assist you in this purpose, the committee on estimates will again be requested to review the expenditures of several departments.
You will be invited to re-establish the special committee on broadcasting so that it may continue its consideration of broadcasting policy, particularly in the field of regulation and licensing.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the Commons:
May divine Providence bless you and guide you in your duties."
10,24,4,1960-11-18,conservative,"Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I greet you as you resume your parliamentary duties.
In the course of tjie year I have travelled through our country from ocean to ocean and have been happy to observe everywhere the fealty and devotion of all Canadians to the crown.
We meet in a world of continued international tension which has prompted my government to redouble its efforts to bring about a general acceptance of peaceful means of settling disputes. It has reaffirmed its readiness to co-operate in the United Nations and elsewhere in the development of conditions that would lead to the attainment of this goal. My prime minister and other representatives of the government have stated forcefully the views of Canada on these matters and they have received widespread support from the Canadian people.
The commonwealth has continued to demonstrate its vitality. Nigeria was welcomed to full commonwealth membership at the beginning of last month and additional new members will enter this coming year. Continuing constitutional development in the commonwealth is likely to be considered at a, prime ministers' conference in 1961.
Disarmament under international control is the key to an enduring world peace. My government has accordingly maintained its unremitting efforts to achieve progress in this field. Until such time as disarmament under effective control can be achieved, however, it is necessary to ask you to maintain well-trained and well-armed Canadian defence forces, adequate to meet Canada's defence obligations. My ministers will reaffirm Canada's support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a defensive alliance dedicated to maintaining the peace.
. The unanimous approval given by the United Nations to a joint resolution embodying the essence of the Canadian proposal for a United Nations food bank is a matter for satisfaction.
Important international tariff negotiations began in September in Geneva and will last well into next year; my ministers have made clear that these negotiations should be used as a means of finding solutions to the current European trade problems in a manner that will not harm the interests of other trading nations.
Important conferences with the provincial governments have taken place in recent months. In accordance with the objective expressed by the prime minister early in your last sessioh, two meetings have been held at which progress has been made in discussion of means of amending the constitution of Canada in Canada and relieving the parliament at Westminster of its residual responsibility in regard to the British North America Act. Further meetings have been arranged. Two conferences on fiscal arrangements have been held and further exchanges of views will take place. You will in due course be asked to approve legislation concerning dominion-provincial fiscal arrangements for the period commencing April .1962. 
At the present time Canada's foreign trade is at a record level and exports to the United Kingdom and commonwealth countries have shown a remarkable increase this year. Economic expansion has also had the result that more Canadians have been employed this year than in any previous year and labour income is at an all-time high. The government recognizes, however, the necessity of continuing the expansion of the national economy at a pace sufficient to provide jobs for the record numbers who are now entering the labour force, as well as jobs for those who are displaced by automation and other technological changes.
Accordingly you will be asked to approve measures designed to increase immediate employment opportunities and also measures which will constitute a large further instalment in the long range program of national development.
Among the first measures, the government has already announced its intention of seeking your approval of another and larger program of assistance to municipalities for winter works projects; this announcement has already given rise to intense efforts across Canada in which all levels of government are joining. My ministers have also expressed their intention of carrying out all possible federal works during the winter. In recommending approval of these programs to you, my ministers are confident that provinces and municipalities, business and labour, and all citizens will co-operate in a continuing effort to put more Canadians to work.
With a view to avoiding any interruption in the building of urgently needed hospitals, it is deemed appropriate to announce now the intention of the government to recommend to parliament that the federal grants for hospital construction be continued for a further five-year period after the expiration of the present period in March 1963.
Another special winter housing program has been undertaken; the terms of housing and home improvements loans have been modified within the National Housing Act to encourage additional building activity; in addition, you will be asked to amend the act to make further improvement in the terms of mortgage lending. You will also be asked, as a means of providing low rent housing more economically, and counteracting urban blight, to authorize the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, in partnership with provincial authorities, to undertake the purchase, improvement and rental of existing housing in specified areas of urban redevelopment, just as such partnerships now build and rent new housing units.
The housing legislation put before you will also contain provisions to authorize the corporation to make loans to universities for students' residences on terms similar to those of loans made for limited dividend housing projects.
The pollution of Canada's water supplies is a serious problem confronting many communities; its correction or prevention involves substantial further investment in sound urban development. It will therefore be proposed to you that the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation be authorized to make long term loans to local authorities for approved projects for sewage disposal and treatment, up to two thirds of the costs of such projects, on terms similar to those of loans for limited dividend housing projects. As a special incentive for prompt action on this urgent problem, parliament will be asked to authorize the crown to write off one quarter of the amount of any such loan expended on work done before April 1963.
Believing that the ultimate success of efforts to improve Canada's trade and employment and the standard of living of Canadian workers depends largely upon increasing Canadian productivity, my ministers will ask you to authorize the establishment of a productivity council. Its membership would include Canadians from the fields of industry and commerce, organized labour, agriculture and other primary production, as well as qualified individuals chosen from the public at large and from the scientific agencies of government. The purpose of this council would be to strengthen Canada's competitive position in export and domestic markets by improving the productivity of primary and secondary industries.
You will also be asked to give early consideration to a bill authorizing government guarantees for bank loans to small businesses to finance additions and improvements to their business premises and equipment. My ministers are convinced that additional medium term credit facilities for small businesses would enable many private projects to go forward this winter all across Canada, providing substantial additional employment. Moreover, this addition to our credit legislation will constitute a continuing stimulus to the growth of Canadian private enterprise.
A bill will also be laid before you to extend the assistance given to provincial governments for vocational training, both in the school system and in the training and retraining of those who have already become workers. With more advanced technology in industry and the need to increase productivity, better technical training of the youth of Canada is required and more retraining of Canadian workers who have to transfer to other jobs or trades. This is particularly necessary in those areas where job opportunities in traditional industries are limited. In order to get this program under way quickly, you will be asked to approve grants of 75 per cent of the amounts expended, up to March 31, 1963, in building approved technical schools or training institutions.
Amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act will be placed before you to safeguard the basic purpose of the act, to strengthen the fund and to correct abuses which have developed in practice.
As an additional step in the national agricultural program, you will also be asked to approve enabling legislation to authorize the federal government to join with provincial authorities and local groups throughout Canada in comprehensive programs of rural rehabilitation and development. My ministers believe that as farming is a basic Canadian industry it must be made more stable and remunerative. Widening the uses of Canada's farm lands and water resources will be necessary for this purpose.
Among other measures in the long range program, you will be requested to approve a number of major projects of national development. The largest of these will be the development of the water power on the Columbia river. Agreement has been reached with the government of the United States on a plan for the co-operative development of the use of these waters and a treaty will be submitted to you for approval in due course. You will also be asked to take the action necessary to fulfil Canada's part in implementing it.
You will be requested to approve several projects of railway development in opening up Canada's frontier. One of these will be a Canadian National Railway line to the new mining area near Matta-gami lake in northwestern Quebec, which will aid in the rapid expansion of the mineral industry of that great province.
You will be asked to appropriate funds to enable a detailed survey to be made of the western route for the railway from northern Alberta to Great Slave lake.
Other major projects for which appropriations will be requested include a floodway to protect the city of Winnipeg and nearby communities and works to conserve and control the waters of the upper Thames river in southwestern Ontario.
My government has decided that the modernization of the Customs Tariff of Canada, on which much has been accomplished in recent years, should be substantially accelerated. To make this feasible on a sound and fair basis, you will be asked to enlarge the tariff board and authorize it to sit in two panels.
You will also be asked to revise the definition in the Customs Tariff of goods of a class or kind made in Canada.
It is the intention of my Minister of Finance to present a supplementary budget to you before the Christmas recess.
You will be invited to consider means by which to encourage a greater participation by Canadians in the ownership and control of industry and resources in Canada.
You will be asked to approve legislation requiring the disclosure of information by business and labour organizations in Canada controlled from outside Canada.
You will be asked to amend legislation to enlarge the investment and other powers of insurance companies.
Amendments to the Pensions Act will be recommended, which will include substantial increases in the pensions payable to veterans or their dependants.
You will also be asked to consider means of encouraging the youth of Canada in amateur athletics.
A bill to revise the Civil Service Act will again be submitted for your approval. A bill to revise the Immigration Act will be laid before you. You will also be asked to revise the Penitentiaries Act to bring it into accord with my minister's policies of correctional reform. Amendments will be proposed to the Criminal Code having to do with capital punishment and with the treatment of criminal sexual psychopaths.
It is considered desirable to provide for broader representation on the board of directors of the Canadian National Railway; legislation will be introduced to increase the number of directors accordingly.
Amendments to the Canada Shipping Act will be proposed.
Other legislation and amendments to a number of other statutes will also be proposed. Several special committees will be re-established.
Members of the House of Commons:
The estimates of amounts required for the public service and the payments authorized by parliament will be laid before you. These will include an appropriation for the work of the royal commission on government organization which has been recently established to recommend improvements in the organization and methods of operation of the departments and agencies of the government which it thinks will best promote efficiency, economy and improved service in the dispatch of public business.

We look forward to the presence this summer of Her Majesty the Queen Mother, who for many years has endeared herself to the hearts of all Canadians. We shall also have the pleasure of receiving Their Royal Highnesses the Duke of Edinburgh and the Princess Royal.
During the past year, I have visited several provinces and made an extensive trip to the Northwest Territories. The great north brought home to me the vastness, the far horizons and the beauty of our country. Flying over it, X thought of the wonderful heritage which Providence has entrusted to us. May we be worthy of this stewardship.
While the world outlook contains elements of continuing danger, there are some grounds for cautious optimism. Major military conflicts have been avoided and the processes of conciliation and negotiation are in progress or in prospect on many of the important international issues. The Canadian government remains devoted to peace as its primary objective.
Recurrent Soviet pressure on Berlin makes it necessary for the governments of the North Atlantic alliance to reconcile the preservation of essential rights and interests with a constant readiness to discuss and enter into equitable and safeguarded engagements. My government has consistently worked towards that end, and approves the resumption of preliminary talks with the U.S.S.R., the success of which will depend on Soviet good faith.
In other areas of tension, Canada has been prominent in international efforts to relieve political, economic and administrative strains which have sometimes accompanied the transition from dependent to independent status of new nations. International peace keeping arrangements continue to warrant effective Canadian support.
International agreements on measures of controlled disarmament remain vitally necessary if the world is to be freed permanently from the menace of war. As a member of the expanded disarmament committee recently reconstituted, my government supports the decision to resume disarmament negotiations in March.
The commonwealth continues to grow as an important instrument for freedom and peace, linking five continents and people of many races. The strengthening of this association is a primary objective of my government. During 1961, Canada joined in welcoming Cyprus, Sierra Leone and Tanganyika to full membership in the commonwealth.
My government derives particular satisfaction from the endorsement by the United Nations of
a world food program sponsored by Canada, for which you will be asked to authorize a contribution.
You will also be asked to appropriate funds to maintain Canada's external aid program.
Canada's diplomatic representation has been expanded in the commonwealth, in the French speaking countries of Africa, and as well in Latin America and in Asia.
While striving to reduce international tensions and promote the peaceful settlement of international disputes, my government still considers it necessary to provide the support required to strengthen and maintain the defence forces necessary to continue an active role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Important negotiations are now under way between the British government and the European economic community following the decision of Britain to ascertain whether terms can be negotiated on which it might become a member of that community. My ministers are following these negotiations carefully, having in mind that their outcome should give full recognition of the vital interests of the commonwealth and to Canada's position and interests as a major trading nation.
My government in recent international meetings has reiterated its support for the expansion of world trade on a multilateral non-discriminatory basis and its readiness to play a constructive role in the promotion of world trade. It stands ready to work with other countries in the pursuit of this goal.
My government plans to recommend to you a number of measures that will constitute further steps in working out the purposes of confederation and identifying more clearly the Canadian nationality in various aspects of public and business affairs. With this purpose in mind, you will be asked to give effect, with modifications, to the recommendations of the royal commission on publications.
By means of conferences with representatives of provincial governments, progress has been made toward agreement on a means of amending our constitution in Canada, which would be the final step to bring our formal legal position into line with reality. A formula to accomplish this purpose has been sent to provincial governments for their consideration.
Legislation will be proposed to require reports to be submitted by business and labour organizations concerning the extent and nature of their operations and whether, and to what extent, they may be owned or controlled outside Canada.
A measure relating to the Senate will be placed before you.
My government will ask you to take steps to ensure that the forthcoming redistribution of electoral districts is made in an equitable manner upon an objective basis. To this end you will be asked to approve for the first time in our history a measure to create an independent commission to recommend the changes required in the electoral districts as a result of the decennial census.
Comprehensive measures to put into effect my government's economic policies were enacted in preceding sessions of this parliament. The benefits flowing from these policies are now evident in record levels of employment, of production, and of export trade. There has been a substantial improvement since last year in the unemployment situation. As the result of the efforts of my government through its municipal winter works incentive program, notable progress has been made in meeting the recurrent problem of seasonal unemployment. The government has already announced its intention of asking you to approve
another and larger program of assistance to municipalities for winter works projects.
Further measures to stimulate economic activity and promote national development will be placed before you this session. One of these will be the construction of a railway in the Gaspe peninsula from Matane to Ste. Anne des Monts. Another will be the construction of a floodway and other works to conserve and control the waters of the Red and Assiniboine rivers in Manitoba, for which agreement has now been reached with the province regarding the division of costs.
Other measures which will help to enlarge employment by stimulating economic activity will include a bill to increase the total amount of financing of exports which can be undertaken by the Export Credits Insurance Corporation and an amendment to broaden the scope of the Small Businesses Loans Act.
The success of the recent ""Resources for Tomorrow"" conference demonstrated the benefits of co-operation between governments in this field. My government, in consultation with the governments of the ten provinces, is examining suggestions made at that conference for co-operative measures to encourage the wise management and multiple use of Canada's natural resources.
The provision of low cost electric power is one of the most important factors in the economic growth and industrial development of Canada. As a further step in the national development policy, my Prime Minister has invited the provincial governments to join with the federal government in early discussions of the steps that might be taken toward the establishment of longdistance power transmission to link provinces and eventually the different regions of Canada.
You will be asked to provide for an expanded program of encouragement to scientific research by industry in Canada.
A bill will be placed before you intended to enable Canada to participate effectively in arrangements for reinforcing the international monetary fund when additional resources are required to maintain stability in exchange markets in the face of substantial capital movements.
The maintenance of fair prices for farm and fishery products also continues to be a matter of prime concern to my government and you will be asked to provide the funds necessary to sustain the price stabilization policy. My ministers have achieved a gratifying success in finding markets for grain and thereby reducing surplus stocks. The drought in the prairie provinces during 1961 has resulted in severe losses, however, and you will be asked to provide assistance by means of acreage payments to the farmers who have been affected. Legislation will also be proposed to extend the period of application of the Farm Improvement Loans Act and the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act.
Important measures in the field of social welfare will also be proposed at this session. Your approval will be requested for an increase in the amount of the universal old age pension payable under the Old Age Security Act, and also for legislation to increase the amount to which the federal government will contribute under the Old Age Assistance Act, the Blind Persons Act and the Disabled Persons Act. After the concurrence of the provinces for the necessary amendment to section 94A of the British North America Act has been secured, parliament will be asked to approve a constitutional amendment in order to permit the introduction of a contributory system of old age pensions and related survivors' and disability benefits which will be in addition to the existing old age pension legislation and will
take into account private pension arrangements and the need for legislation concerning portability of pension rights.
You will be asked to authorize the establishment of a national council of welfare similar to the council of health which has had a long record of usefulness.
You will be asked to approve an amendment to the Civilian War Pensions and Allowances Act to authorize the payment of allowances under specified conditions to merchant seamen, firefighters, foresters, members of voluntary aid detachments and certain other civilians whose war services overseas have been recognized in other respects. Other amending bills will provide for increased allowances and other improvements in the Children of War Dead (Education Assistance) Act and also for the extension of the effective period of the War Services Grants Act and the Veterans Insurance Act and for the extension of the qualifying period under the Veterans Land Act.
My government will also ask you to appropriate moneys required in the unemployment insurance fund to safeguard the rights of workers until the report of the special committee inquiring into the unemployment insurance program has been received and can be acted upon.
You will be asked to increase the federal grants to universities and make suitable provision in those cases where alternative arrangements are made for supplementary provincial grants in lieu of federal grants.
My government is initiating negotiations with the provincial and municipal authorities with a view to removing the tolls on the Victoria and Jacques Cartier bridges in Montreal; should these be successful you will be asked to approve legislation for this purpose.
You will be asked to authorize the institution of an automobile ferry service between North Sydney, Nova Scotia, and Argentia, Newfoundland, and to provide for the construction of the necessary vessel and docks.
Other measures will be introduced to amend the Broadcasting Act, the Canada Shipping Act, the Canadian National Railways Capital Revision Act, the Bankruptcy Act and a number of other statutes. You will be asked to approve the ratification of the universal copyright convention. Members of the House of Commons;
My government intends to ask you to reconstitute the special committee on procedure of the house and request it to make recommendations on the elimination of closure of debates in the House of Commons.
The estimates required for the public service and for payments authorized by parliament will be laid before you.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I pray that God in His wisdom may grant you light and	grace	in	your	deliberations	and the
fulfilment of your duties."
12,25,1,1962-09-28,conservative,"Legislation respecting the Senate will be introduced.
To ensure that the redistribution of electoral districts is made objectively and impartially, you will be asked to approve a bill to establish an independent commission to recommend redistribution.
A measure will be placed before you to establish an Indian claims commission to investigate claims on the part of various tribes and bands that certain of their rights have been restricted or abrogated, and to make recommendations for the equitable and final settlement of such claims.
Economic activity in Canada has moved ahead sharply. This strong advance has resulted in more than 200,000 new jobs during the past twelve months. The objective of my government is to accelerate this pace of advance. This would mean the creation over the next five years of more than 1 million new jobs and a corresponding growth in gross national product and in production for both the export and domestic market, already at record levels.
Such high levels of activity have not prevented the emergence of foreign exchange difficulties similar to those which confronted Canada in crisis proportions in 1947, and to those which have affected other major trading nations more recently. In June my government found it necessary to put into immediate effect a comprehensive program to strengthen the country's exchange reserves. Since that time Canada's exchange reserves have increased substantially. It is my government's firm intention to remove the import surcharges included in this program as soon as circumstances permit.
My government will continue to take positive, constructive measures to strengthen Canada's balance of international payments. The recently stabilized exchange rate for the Canadian dollar has greatly helped Canadian producers in all parts of Canada both in the domestic and export markets. The new exchange rate is contributing as well to a large expansion in the Canadian tourist industry, which has also been aided by joint efforts of the federal and provincial governments.
Canada's development will continue to require imports of capital, and to this end my government will maintain a climate in Canada hospitable to foreign investment.
As one of my government's measures to develop the Canadian economy, maintain a high level of employment and strengthen the balance of payments, you will be asked to approve legislation establishing a national economic development board. This board would be broadly representative and would review and report upon the state of the economy and upon economic policies. It would also have the duty of recommending to the government particular projects or measures which it considers would be in the interest of national development, including projects which may require direct governmental participation by way of financial aid or otherwise.
The objective of my ministers is a balanced budget. This will require the exercise of restraint in respect of controllable spending and an increased concentration of available resources on essential national projects designed to ensure the expansion of the Canadian economy. Steps will be taken to improve further the efficiency of government operations. The report of the royal commission on government organization will be helpful in achieving this improvement of administration while maintaining the high status of the Canadian public service. A program of economies in government expenditures will be reflected in the revised estimates to be placed before you.
A royal commission has been established to review the whole field of federal taxation and its impact on the Canadian economy, and to recommend reforms and improvements.
The purposes of the fiscal measures to be placed before you at this session will be the creation of better employment opportunities for the Canadian people, the promotion of a high rate of economic growth, the strengthening of Canada's balance of international payments and the maintenance of stability in prices. New budget measures will be introduced to provide further solutions to long teirm problems.
My ministers will reintroduce the resolutions submitted in the last budget which had as its central purpose the encouragement of economic growth. This will include the production incentive provided to manufacturing and processing companies by cancelling one half of the tax on the first $50,000 of taxable income arising from increased sales and one quarter of the increased tax on any additional income arising from increased sales. It will also include the measure to grant to individuals and companies the right to charge petroleum drilling and exploration expenses against income from oil and gas production, and to permit certain expenditures made to acquire oil and gas rights to be deductible for tax purposes. The measure to allow a special tax credit in respect of provincial logging taxes will also be reintroduced in order to remove discrimination in the taxation of logging operations. Iron mining companies will be added to the list of companies which are exempt from the special tax on income earned in Canada by branches of non-resident corporations. The measure will also be reintroduced to increase by $50 per year the income tax deductions allowed for children.
My government intends to press forward in cooperation with Canadian industry to secure a greater and more rapid application of science to industrial production. You will be asked to approve the new tax incentive announced in the last budget for corporations undertaking increased expenditures on scientific research in Canada. Dramatic evidence of successful co-operation between Canadian science and industry has been given this week in the opening of Canada's first nuclear power generating station.
Canada's prosperity and growth must ultimately rest in large measure upon its exports. To achieve adequate export levels it will be necessary to increase further Canada's capacity to produce competitively and its ability to sell in export markets. The government's industrial programs are directed toward these ends. Its commercial policy negotiations have the objective of opening additional markets to Canadian producers in fair exchange for opportunities for others to sell in Canada. The vigorous campaign of export trade promotion will be expanded to enlarge the sales of Canadian products in foreign markets. You will be asked to provide the funds necessary for this increasing trade promotion work. Amendments to the Export Credits Insurance Act will also be placed before you, to double the insurance liability which the corporation may assume and to improve the arrangements for long term financing.
You will be asked to authorize the establishment of an Atlantic development board to advise on measures and projects that will promote the economic development of the Atlantic region of Canada.
Amendments will be requested in the Industrial Development Bank Act to enlarge still further this bank's important role in national development.
The prosperity of agriculture remains essential to the well-being of the entire Canadian economy. Canada is blessed this year with very large crops of good quality, and export markets for Canadian agricultural products have been greatly enlarged.
My ministers recognize that livestock is occupying a position of increasing importance in Canadian agriculture. They propose that a program
be instituted to ensure the availability of storage facilities and continuity of supplies of feed grain to match the expanding requirements for livestock production, particularly in the areas of British Columbia and eastern Canada where supplies of feed grain are normally deficient.
The program of rehabilitation and development of agricultural lands is proceeding actively and you will be asked to provide funds for it.
Legislation will be proposed to enlarge the funds of the Farm Credit Corporation, and allow greater flexibility in their use.
The need for training in agriculture and the present facilities have also been under review and as a sequel to these studies, a national conference on agricultural training is to be convened this fall.
The development and use of Canada's resources of energy must be a central feature of the program for national economic growth. The twenty fourth parliament has laid the groundwork for this in the National Energy Board Act and in other measures.
It is hoped that arrangements will soon be completed that will make it possible to submit for your approval the Columbia river treaty and the legislation required in parliament to implement it.
The national oil policy introduced by the government two years ago has brought about a gratifying increase in the production and sale of Canadian oil.
Studies will be continued, in co-operation with the provinces, in relation to the long distance high voltage transmission of electrical power and the development of potential sources of hydroelectric power with a view to the ultimate establishment of a national power grid, which will facilitate the orderly utilization of the hydroelectric potential of Canada in the interests of expanding Canadian development and progress. Discussions are in progress with the government of Manitoba in respect to studies of the Nelson river system.
My ministers have come to the conclusion that large scale, long term contracts for the export of power surplus to Canada's needs, present and potential, should now be encouraged in order to expedite the development of major power projects in Canada which are too large to be supported by the domestic market. Such exports can also strengthen our balance of payments.
In recognition of the important role of transportation in the Canadian economy, you will be asked to approve measures to give effect to recommendations of the royal commission on transportation which has now completed its comprehensive analysis of the Canadian railway problem. These changes are intended to remove the need for general horizontal freight rate increases which have borne so heavily in the past upon certain areas and groups of producers. You will also be asked to provide for an extension of the Freight Rates Reduction Act and the other interim railway subsidies provided by appropriation.
Amendments will be proposed to the Canada Shipping Act to preserve for Canadian vessels the coasting trade in the St. Lawrence and great lakes area. Funds will be requested to implement the program of shipbuilding subsidies announced some months ago.
You will be asked to provide for the continuation of the winter works program to assist municipalities in meeting seasonal unemployment.
Far reaching changes are taking place in manpower requirements in Canadian industries as a result of automation, other technological developments and world competitive pressures. A measure will be placed before you designed to assist employers, workers and their organizations in meeting the impact of industrial change.
My government will also place before you legislation to provide safeguards against accidents and hazards in works and undertakings within the federal fields of jurisdiction.
The committee inquiring into matters relating to the unemployment insurance fund is expected to submit its report this autumn. Following consideration of this report, appropriate measures will be placed before you.
In order to permit the introduction of a national system of contributory old age pensions with disability and survivor benefits, an amendment to the British North America Act is required. The governments of all provinces except Quebec and Newfoundland have concurred in such an amendment. My government is prepared to recommend to you the approval of an address to Her Majesty requesting the amendment when the concurrence of these remaining provinces has been received.
As pension plans have become ever more widely extended in Canadian business, it has been increasingly recognized that measures are essential to protect the interests of those affected and in particular to ensure that the benefits earned are portable when workers move from job to job. Provincial legislation would be required for this purpose in most cases, and several provinces are considering proposals of this nature. My government will be prepared to place before you complementary legislation to deal with industries under federal jurisdiction when adequate progress has been made by provinces.
A measure will be placed before you to authorize the establishment of a national council of welfare to make more fully effective the action of both federal and provincial governments in this field.
You will be asked to approve amendments to the Food and Drugs Act to provide for more effective control of the distribution and sale of drugs in the interests of the public health.
You will be asked to enact legislation to provide for the establishment of a national medical research council.
Legislation will be reintroduced to authorize the payment by federal crown corporations of certain provincial commodity taxes and fees.
Legislation will be proposed on university grants which will include authorization of payment of the higher grants announced some months ago and will provide alternative arrangements where supplementary provincial grants are made in lieu of federal grants.
A bill will be introduced to authorize a revision and codification of all federal statutes.
Bills will be introduced to amend the Judges Act, the Aeronautics Act, the Bankruptcy Act, the Coal Production Assistance Act and the Currency, Mint and Exchange Fund Act, and other statutes.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on the services and payments approved by parliament.
You will be asked to abolish closure and to reestablish the special committee on procedure of the house.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the Commons:
I pray that God in His wisdom may enlighten you in the discharge of your duty toward our country."
13,26,1,1963-05-17,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I welcome you to the first session of the twenty sixth parliament of Canada.
X am honoured today to act for His Excellency the Governor General, whose place in the respect of the Canadian people is second only to that of Her Majesty the Queen and whose early recovery to full health is sincerely wished by us all. I know that all members of this parliament would wish to join in expressing to Her Majesty the sentiments of loyalty which were recently conveyed to her by the Prime Minister.
You are deliberating the course of our country in times of great change throughout the world. These are times that test old virtues. They are times that open up new opportunities. Familiar ways of thought and action are becoming less certain guides. Many old paths are no longer open to us. The task before us is to seek out, with wisdom and imagination, those new paths that will lead us surely forward.
As Canadians we can work with hope. Our country has a proud history. Now there are expanding opportunities open to us. But they depend on our overcoming serious problems. It is only with courage and perseverance and hard work that we will achieve the better life that is within our power, for ourselves and for our children.
Our progress is the work of all the people. In a free country, we are all responsible. The determination of my ministers is that the government through its policies will contribute the leadership, the purpose, the decision that are its responsibilities to the people.
The character and strength of our nation are drawn from the diverse cultures of people who came from many lands to create the Canada that is ours today. The greater Canada that is in our power to make will be built not on uniformity but on continuing diversity, and particularly on the basic partnership of English speaking and French speaking people. My ministers are determined that the partnership shall be truly equal. For that high purpose they are establishing, in consultation with the governments of the provinces, a commission charged to study, thoroughly but urgently, how the fundamentally bicultural character of Canada may best be assured and the contribution of other cultures recognized.
To make us a more united people, the government will in all things strive to strengthen and to give new direction to our Canadian confederation. It will foster the spirit of co-operative federalism, fully respecting the rights of the provinces while safeguarding and extending the equality of opportunity which properly belongs to all Canadians in all parts of our country. In these purposes, as in others, my ministers will seek frequent consultation with the governments of the provinces.
The principles of Canadian external policy are those of the United Nations charter, to maintain peace with justice and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; and to promote the welfare of all peoples by international co-operation. My ministers will seek solutions to international problems by diplomacy and negotiation. In particular, my ministers will strive to lessen international tensions and halt the arms race by seeking measures of controlled disarmament, including a treaty to end nuclear tests under reasonable safeguards.
Meantime, my ministers believe that there is no alternative to the maintenance of the defences of the free nations as a deterrent to war. In particular, a strong North Atlantic Treaty Organization, including adequate defence on the north American continent, remains essential to Canada's security. For this purpose, the armed forces of Canada should have available the modern weapons necessary to perform effectively the defensive tasks which Canada has undertaken in the alliance. Next week, we will take pleasure in welcoming to Ottawa the ministerial council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. My government is convinced that on the foundation of the present alliance a true community of the Atlantic peoples will one day be achieved.
In recent weeks the Prime Minister has had friendly and constructive discussions with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and with the President of the United States of America. By such visits and other means the government will continue to improve political and economic relationships with other countries. It is my ministers' intention to assist in enhancing the unique value of the commonwealth partnership in international relations.
Canada's economic progress is vitally dependant on vigorous economic expansion throughout the world. We must expect continuing rapid changes in international trading relationships, changes that face Canada both with problems of adjustment and with new opportunities. My ministers believe that the nations can best achieve economic progress through policies that steadily reduce the barriers limiting trade. It is equally important to pursue active policies for the economic development of the newer nations, for the expansion of trade in primary commodities at reasonably stable prices, and for the improvement of international payments.
Canada will take a constructive part in trade and other economic negotiations. In order to increase employment and production in Canada, it is the purpose of my ministers to expand Canada's export
trade, to strengthen our payments balance with other countries, and to ensure increasingly high confidence in our economy and currency.
Steady work is the basic need on which men and women depend for the well-being of themselves and their families. Unemployment, on the serious scale of recent years, is therefore the most urgent of our domestic problems. To provide the many new jobs that are needed every year, we must create new industries. The fiscal and monetary policies of the government will give priority to the encouragement of soundly based industrial expansion.
Provision will be made to assist labour and management to make manpower adjustments required by technological and other industrial changes. The special assistance for technical training will be extended in co-operation with the provinces.
Other measures will be put before you to assist in increasing production and employment in Canada.
You will be asked to provide for the early establishment of a department of industry, which will foster industrial expansion and provide a central point to which industry can look for consultation, stimulus and assistance. It will be proposed that, within the new department, there will be established an area development agency. This agency will work with the provincial governments and other organizations to co-ordinate programs for parts of the country where, because of chronic unemployment, a special thrust for development is needed.
Amendments to the Atlantic Development Board Act will be proposed, to strengthen the board and to provide for a capital assistance fund through which it can promote basic projects in the Atlantic region.
You will be asked to establish a municipal development and loan board, through which municipalities may obtain, with the approval of the provinces, loans and grants to carry out projects which will increase employment and improve services. Amendments to the National Housing Act will also be proposed.
A measure will be placed before you to establish a Canada development corporation, by means of which Canadians can more readily direct their savings to the building of new Canadian industries and to increasing the Canadian ownership of existing industries, which is one of the important objectives of the government.
A measure will be placed before you to establish an economic council of Canada, in order to assist the government, industry and labour to develop means of ensuring in Canada the highest possible levels of employment, of efficient production, and of sustained growth for our economy.
My ministers will pursue constructive policies for the development of Canada's great resources for the benefit of Canadians.
The government will undertake discussions with the government of British Columbia and with the United States, aimed at securing action on the development of the Columbia river.
A new Department of Agriculture act will be placed before you, to provide for two ministers in order that the needs of agriculture in both eastern and western Canada may receive closer attention. My ministers will institute new programs to make farming as a whole more stable and more prosperous. They will strive to expand markets for Canadian farm products both at home and abroad, with special attention to dairy products.
The government is initiating consultation with the provinces to work out a program for national fishery development. My ministers intend to secure the establishment of a twelve mile limit for the use of the Canadian fisheries, taking proper account of treaty and historic rights.
Internal Economy Commission
You will be asked to continue the existing payments to the railways, pending the approval of long-term measures concerning transportation. You will be asked to provide additional assistance for the completion of the trans-Canada highway.
My ministers have undertaken to establish a comprehensive system of contributory pensions. The new pensions will be co-ordinated with the existing provisions for old-age security, for the purpose of enabling all Canadians to retire in security and with dignity. While the arrangements required for this great advance in the social security of our people are necessarily complex, the legislation submitted to you will be designed to make the new pension plan operative as soon as possible.
Legislation on unemployment insurance is under consideration and in the meantime you will be asked to ensure that the fund is sustained to meet the claims on it.
The redistribution of electoral districts is overdue. You will be asked to authorize the establishment of a commission to undertake this important task.
A change in the Citizenship Act will be proposed to ensure full equality of rights for all Canadian citizens wherever they were bom. Immigration policy will be reviewed.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required for the services and payments authorized by parliament.
You will be invited to establish a special committee of the house to examine defence problems.
It will be proposed that the standing committee on privileges and elections review the Canada Elections Act.
You will be asked to agree to the establishment of a committee on procedure, over which the Speaker will preside, with the aim of strengthening parliament and making it more effective.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
In addition to the measures already specified, you will be asked to consider other legislative proposals.
May divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
14,26,2,1964-02-19,liberal,"Members of the House of Commons:
I welcome you to the second session of the twenty sixth parliament of Canada.
This is a time when it is possible, despite our many problems, to deliberate on Canadian and world affairs in a spirit of reasoned hopefulness.
My government will attempt to make its full contribution to the maintenance of peace and the improvement of international relations:	to the
strengthening of our national unity through a cooperative federalism; to fostering the full employment of our people and the efficient growth of our economy; and to broadening the opportunities for a good life which should be open to all Canadians.
We are looking forward to the visit this autumn of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth. The presence of the Queen of Canada will mark for our country the historic occasion of the interprovincial conferences on confederation; it will also re-emphasize the importance we attach to the commonwealth, through which so much can be done to advance understanding and co-operation in this increasingly interdependent world.
We recently had great pleasure in welcoming to Ottawa the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, with whom many matters of mutual concern were fruitfully discussed.
Since the close of the last session of parliament, my Prime Minister has visited France and the United States. His friendly discussions with the President of the Republic of France will help to encourage an increasingly intimate relationship between France and Canada.
The unique partnership of Canada and the United States was symbolized in the signing by the President and the Prime Minister of an agreement by which the two countries become, for the first time, joint owners of property in what is to be the Roosevelt-Campobello international park. You will be asked to approve legislation implementing this agreement.
A protocol signed during the Prime Minister's visit to Washington will make the Columbia river treaty a basis for developments of great advantage to both countries. This was made possible by successful negotiations between my ministers and the government of British Columbia. You will be asked to examine and approve the Columbia river treaty and the protocol.
Canada will this year be taking part in important trade and tariff negotiations. My ministers will negotiate for the expansion of markets for Canadian exports through the liberalization of world trade.
In the conduct of external affairs, my government will continue to work for the conciliation of international differences and for practical steps toward adequately controlled disarmament. Such steps depend on keeping the defences of the free world strong. My government will submit for your approval a statement of a new defence policy designed to maintain an effective Canadian contribution to keeping the peace in co-operation with our allies.
At home there has been a heartening expansion of the economy. Employment has increased at an accelerated rate and the number of Canadians seeking work has fallen. More progress is, however, required. My ministers will propose a variety of measures which will further increase employment and raise the standard of living by strengthening and expanding the primary and secondary industries of Canada.
Comprehensive proposals to reform public regulation of the railways, and to facilitate the adaptation of the railway system to present and future needs, will be submitted for your consideration.
A measure will be placed before you to establish minimum wages, maximum working hours, statutory holidays and other labour standards for work under federal jurisdiction.
A measure will be placed before you to establish a comprehensive system of contributory pensions.
You will be asked to authorize, after consultation with the provinces, arrangements whereby university students requiring such assistance will be able to secure loans without payment of interest during the years of study.
Major amendments to the National Housing Act will be proposed.
You will be asked to approve the changes in fiscal arrangements with the provinces, decided upon at the federal-provincial conference last November, which implement the principle of equalization in provincial revenues from the shared tax fields. It is my ministers' policy to continue the series of federal-provincial conferences which last year achieved considerable progress in improving federal-provincial co-operation.
A measure will be placed before you to provide for a minister responsible for rural development, in order that my government may carry further its policy of giving increased attention to the needs of agriculture in both eastern and western Canada. You will be asked to consider other measures to assist in the improvement of farms and of farm income.
A measure will be placed before you to establish a 12 mile limit for the use of Canadian fisheries. In co-operation with the provinces, my government will undertake a national fisheries development program reflecting the outcome of the federal-provincial conference on fisheries held last month.
You will be asked to consider measures to strengthen the position of periodicals published in Canada.
A measure to provide for the redistribution of electoral districts will be placed before you.
My government intends to institute an inquiry to advise on the best practicable way to set enforceable limits to expenditures in election campaigns.
A measure to establish an age of retirement from the Senate will be placed before you.
You will be asked to consider amendments to the Citizenship Act which will ensure full equality of rights for all Canadian citizens wherever they were born.
You will be asked to consider measures to facilitate the reorganization of government in the interests of more effective and more efficient administration. In particular, a measure will be proposed to establish the treasury board under the presidency of a separate minister, who will devote his full attention to the increasingly urgent problems of the management of the public service and government expenditures. The president of the treasury board will be responsible for implementing other recommendations of the royal commission on government organization.
You will be asked to consider other legislative proposals.
Members of the House of Commons
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required for the services and payments authorized by parliament.
You will be asked to agree to the re-establishment of committees on defence and on the procedures and organization of parliament, and to establish other special committees.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
15,26,3,1965-04-05,liberal,"Members of the House of Commons:
I welcome you to the third session of the twenty sixth Parliament of Canada.
We recall with pleasure the presence last October of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth. The visit of Her Majesty to Charlottetown, Quebec and Ottawa helped us to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the interprovincial conferences that led to Confederation. It also reaffirmed in the hearts of Canadians the cherished place of the monarchy in our national development. The gracious presence and the wise words of the Queen of Canada helped to strengthen the unity of our country and to rededicate Canadians to the sense of purpose that joins us in the pursuit of our common goals as Canadians while leaving us free to develop to the full the facets of our life which reflect the duality of our foundation and the variety of our development.
The international situation gives ground for concern. The stability of South-east Asia is threatened by a deepening crisis in Viet Nam and continued pressures on Malaysia. The United Nations is beset by conflicting political pressures which have seriously impaired its capacity for executive action. The continuance of these situations, and of the policies that have given rise to them, would create serious risks of widening conflict.
My Government is resolved that Canada shall make the fullest contribution it can to the lessening of international tensions, including the pro-
vision of practical assistance to developing countries. In the forthcoming negotiations on the United Nations crisis, the objective of my Ministers will be to contribute to the work of repairing and strengthening the United Nations in order that it may play its proper role in the preservation of world peace and security. My Government will press forward its efforts to assure effective international action for peace keeping and to move toward general disarmament under effective international control. Canada will continue meantime to play its full part in the strengthening of collective defence and in the close collaboration of NATO members on both sides of the Atlantic.
My Government will continue to contribute to the development of the Commonwealth ties which are of major importance to the free world and to the improvement of relations between the continents. My Prime Minister will attend the forthcoming Conference of Commonwealth Prime Ministers which will discuss, among other things, the expansion of trade and the establishment of a Commonwealth Secretariat.
My Ministers attach great importance to Canada's neighbourly relationship with the United States and to the development of practical, mutually beneficial arrangements within that relationship. You will be asked to approve a resolution concerning the important agreement on the automobile industry recently concluded with the United States. Members of the House of Commons:
My Ministers believe that it is imperative to reform the procedures of the House of Commons in order that it may accomplish the large volume of work required to meet the needs of the Canadian people in modern times. My Ministers therefore will submit to you proposals for reform, based both on the valuable work of your committee on procedure and organization and on my Government's study of the procedures which, in the Parliaments at Westminster and elsewhere, have enabled effective debate and criticism to be combined with effective dispatch of public business.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
My Ministers will continue their policy of promoting the strength and unity of the Canadian Confederation. This policy has made possible the achievement and reinforcement on a nation wide basis of programs, in pensions and in other fields, which would not have been attainable but for better procedures of consultation and concerted action with due regard for the federal character of our country. My Ministers will continue to improve the procedures and practices involved in the federal relationship so that all Canadians may feel equally served by Confederation.
After the appropriate provincial concurrence has been signified, you will be asked to approve an Address to the Queen to provide that the constitution of Canada may be amended in Canada by the procedures which have been agreed between my Government and the Governments of all the Provinces.
You will be asked to authorize my Government to provide that ""O Canada"" shall be the National Anthem of Canada and that ""God Save the Queen"" shall be recognized as the Royal Anthem in Canada.
Our country is achieving a high rate of economic growth. Trade is expanding. With growing industrialization, Canadians are enjoying rapidly increasing employment opportunities; incomes and living standards are rising; the number of people out
of work has been reduced to lower levels than for many years.
All the great potentialities of our economy are not, however, being realized. The talents of some of our people are wasted because of poverty, illness, inadequate education and training, inequality in opportunities for work. To combat these problems, to improve the opportunities of people who are now at a disadvantage, is to put new power into economic expansion and to enhance the unity of our country.
My Government therefore is developing a program for the full utilisation of our human resources and the elimination of poverty among our people. It will include improved measures for regional development, the re-employment and training of workers, the redevelopment of rural areas, the assistance of needy people, the renewal of areas now blighted and congested in our cities, and the establishment of new opportunities for young Canadians. Besides strengthening and broadening measures within the federal sphere of responsibility, the plan will be designed to concert them more effectively with provincial programs. Because of the importance of this plan, my Prime Minister will take direct responsibility for its co-ordination, assisted by a special secretariat. My Government will propose the calling of a special federal-provincial conference to seek full co-operation and co-ordination with policies of the Provinces.
As one of the major elements in this plan, my Government's area development program, which has already been of substantial assistance to industrial expansion in areas of high unemployment, will be expanded, in consultation with the Provinces, to other areas where incomes are low. You will be asked to approve measures to aid industrial expansion in these areas and to help people to take full advantage of such improved employment opportunities.
My Government will also propose improved measures to assist the re-employment of workers displaced by automation or affected by other economic changes. These measures to develop our country's human resources will include grants and loans for workers moving to new jobs, improved training programs in industry, extended vocational services particularly for the longer term unemployed, and an expanded program for agricultural manpower. These measures will be taken in co-operation with management and labour and, where appropriate, in conjunction with the Provinces.
You will be asked to approve the creation of a fund for rural economic development and, in order to provide for fuller integration of action for rural development, amendments to the legislation regarding ARDA will be placed before you.
You will be asked to approve the establishment of a Company of Young Canadians, through which the energies and talents of youth can be enlisted in projects for economic and social development both in Canada and abroad.
After further discussions between my Government and the Provinces, you will also be asked to enact a measure to establish a Canada Assistance Plan, providing for federal sharing in the cost of comprehensive programs under which people can be assisted on the basis of their need.
My Government believes that public policy should be directed to improving the quality of health services and to ensuring that all Canadians can obtain needed health care, irrespective of their ability to pay. Accordingly my Government will at an early date meet with the Governments of the Provinces in order to discuss with them the way in which federal and provincial action can most effectively contribute to programs that will provide health services to Canadians on a comprehensive basis.
My Government will propose the re-establishment of a special committee of the House of Commons on food and drugs, and will facilitate its work with the aim of reducing the prices paid by the public for drugs.
My Government is developing new policies to enable farmers generally to achieve larger and more reliable incomes so that their living and working standards will be comparable to those enjoyed in other sectors of our economy. You will be asked to consider measures of special assistance to the family farm in both eastern and western Canada.
My Government's recent action to raise the incomes of dairy farmers will be followed by a comprehensive measure to make possible the development, in co-operation with the Provinces, of new national policies for major farm products, including the establishment of a Canadian Dairy Commission. Action will be taken to improve the movement and marketing of feed grain in eastern Canada and British Columbia.
In order to raise the level of income of Canadian fishermen, a measure will be placed before you to provide for an expanded national fisheries development program.
In order to improve the position of veterans, you will be asked to approve measures to amend the Veterans' Land Act, the Children of War Dead (Education Assistance) Act, the War Veterans' Allowance Act and the Army Benevolent Fund Act.
A measure will be placed before you to amend the Canadian Citizenship Act, particularly in order to ensure full equality of rights for all Canadian citizens wherever they were born.
You will be asked to approve a revision of the Immigration Act in the light of a white paper which will be placed before you, reviewing immigration policy and procedures.
You will be asked to enact legislation to establish an Indian Claims Commission.
A measure to establish an age of retirement from the Senate will be placed before you.
My Government will seek to provide more encouragement to the cultural development of our country. You will be asked to consider a measure to strengthen the position of Canadian publications, amendments to the legislation dealing with broadcasting, and a measure to help the development of a feature film industry in Canada.
In order to encourage the progress of scientific research in Canada you will be asked to enact legislation to establish a Science Council of Canada. You will also be asked to authorize a program for the advancement of industrial technology, designed to make our industry more competitive and efficient.
Arrangements will be made for you to decide the issue of capital punishment. My Government will appoint a special committee to study and make recommendations on a comprehensive policy for the correction and rehabilitation of prisoners.
My Government will appoint a Royal Commission to study the status, form and procedures of adjudicative and regulatory bodies and to investigate the desirability of instituting a parliamentary commissioner or Ombudsman for Canada.
My Government intends to make proposals regarding the limitation and payment of election
Speech from the Throne expenses when it has received and considered the findings of the committee of inquiry.
You will be asked to consider revisions of the Bank Act, the Quebec Savings Banks Act and the Bank of Canada Act; legislation will be proposed to establish a Canada Development Corporation to assist in financing major new industrial developments and in increasing Canadian ownership of business corporations.
My Government will propose a revision of legislation on unemployment insurance; legislation to provide for safety in employment under federal jurisdiction; amendment of the Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act to achieve consistency with the labour standards code; legislation to make collective bargaining and arbitration available to the Public Service; and legislation revising federal superannuation and pension plans to integrate them with the Canada Pension Plan.
You will be asked to consider comprehensive legislation to reform public regulation of the railways and to facilitate the adaptation of the railway system to present and future needs; a measure to provide for the recapitalization of the Canadian National Railways; and amendments to the Aeronautics Act.
Other legislative proposals which you will be asked to consider will include: amendments to the Financial Administration Act to establish the Treasury Board under the presidency of a Minister to be named the president of the Treasury Board; legislation regarding Term 29 of the Union with Newfoundland; a measure regarding conservation of oil and gas under federal jurisdiction; amendments to the Post Office Act, the National Housing Act, the Atlantic Development Board Act, the Northwest Territories Act, the Bankruptcy Act and other legislation.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required for the services and payments authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
16,27,1,1966-01-19,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I welcome you to the first session of the Twenty-seventh Parliament of Canada. As we meet on the eve of our Centennial year, It is fitting to reaffirm the values and purposes that unite all our people, and to work, with resolution and patriotism for their realization. We should be very proud to be Canadians.
Our country is continuing to make economic and social progress while playing a responsible role in world affairs. As a member of the United Nations, as a member of the Commonwealth of which our beloved Queen is the Head, and as a partner in the North Atlantic Alliance, Canada will strive to make the greatest possible contribution to improve international relations and assure peace with justice to all peoples. Our capacity for national achievement, like that of other countries, depends on the peace and prosperity of the world community.
Canada will continue strongly to support the efforts of Britain, the Commonwealth and the international community to bring an end to the present illegal situation in Rhodesia. My Prime Minister has recently attended a meeting of Commonwealth leaders in Nigeria, at which this critical issue was discussed and the value of the Commonwealth as a multi-racial association confirmed.
The recent official visit to the Caribbean region made by the Prime Minister reflects the importance my Government attaches to strengthening relationships in economic matters between Canada and Commonwealth countries in this area.
In the United Nations, Canada will continue its efforts, in concert with other countries, to develop means of keeping the peace and strengthening the influence of the world organization. My Government will also do everything it can to assist in finding a basis for negotiating a peaceful settlement of the Vietnam conflict. We shall do our utmost through the United Nations and the Disarmament Committee to foster arrangements for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and for progress towards disarmament. For the security of the North Atlantic community and the stability of Europe, my Government will seek to preserve and strengthen the unity and effectiveness of the North Atlantic Alliance.
International objectives must be pursued by economic and social as well as political means. My Government will recommend to Parliament further measures to improve and develop international economic conditions and to strengthen the Canadian economy.
My Government intends progressively to develop its external aid programs. You will be asked to approve Canada's participation in the Asian Development Bank.
My Government recognizes that Canada has an obligation to share in efforts to prevent or limit armed conflict. Our object, within the limits of our capacity, must be to improve the prospects of world peace and prosperity.
My Government will continue to strengthen the capacity of the integrated Canadian Defence Forces to provide for the security of Canada and to contribute abroad to the preservation of peace. Amendments to the National Defence Act will be laid before you.
The preservation and strengthening of Canadian identity and unity is the most important trust and responsibility of Parliament and of my Government. That unity rests on a Canadianism based upon the two main cultural strands, British and French, enriched by the contributions of other cultural groups, and recognizing the essential contribution of all to the development of Canadian identity.
The approach of the Centennial of Confederation makes it of the utmost importance that Canadians in all parts of the country should look to Ottawa as its true capital where they can feel at home. To this end my Government will continue to work
toward the broadening of the bilingual character of the public service. The national capital should increasingly reflect the nature of the Canadian society.
In its relations with the Provinces, my Government is guided by the conviction that Canadian federalism must draw its vitality and strength from the mutual respect and co-operation of the national and provincial governments. The Canadian people can be well served by their political institutions only if each element in our federal system is able to act effectively within its constitutional sphere. While respecting fully the responsibilities of the provinces, the Government is equally resolved to maintain the constitutional responsibilities of the federal authority.
The Tax Structure Committee, in which the federal and provincial governments, by a common effort, are making a fundamental review of their relations in matters of finance, is nearing the end of its task. The Committee is expected to present recommendations to the Federal-Provincial Conference which will meet later in the year to consider how fiscal relations between the federal and provincial governments might best be adjusted to strengthen each authority in the discharge of its constitutional responsibilities.
My Government will accordingly submit to you legislation respecting federal-provincial fiscal arrangements to become effective in 1967.
It remains the objective of my Ministers to provide that the Constitution of Canada may be amended in Canada.
You will be asked to authorize my Government to provide that ""O Canada"" shall be the national anthem and that ""God Save the Queen"" shall be the royal anthem in Canada.
A measure will be placed before you to provide for the re-organization of certain departments of government, in order to adapt the structure of administration to new and changing conditions and so better meet the needs of our people. The purpose of this re-organization is to provide for closer and better co-ordinated action in the following areas of public policy: manpower policies, which are essential to the sustained growth of a highly productive economy and to the elimination of pockets of poverty within that economy; rural development programs, which are necessary to agricultural progress and a better rural life; integrated federal policies with respect to energy and resources; the special needs of the indigenous people of Canada and of the development of the North; the federal responsibility for laws relating to the conduct of business activity; the problems of corrections and crime, particularly in regard to the effective co-ordination of police services and intelligence in combatting organized crime; and improved management and administration within the public service generally.
For these purposes you will be asked to approve: the conversion of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration into a Department of Manpower; the broadening of the Department of Forestry into a Department of Forestry and Rural Development; the creation of a Department of Energy, Mines and Resources; the conversion of the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources into a Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Affairs; the establishment of a new department responsible for the special areas of legislation concerned with the conduct of business activity; the establishment
of the office of Solicitor General as a full department of government; and the establishment of a Department of the Treasury Board under its own Minister. My Government believes that these changes in organization will enable the processes of administration to respond more speedily and efficiently to the problems of modern times.
Our country is enjoying an unprecedented period of prosperity and growth. Production, investment and trade have expanded rapidly. Employment opportunities have more than kept pace with the rapid increase in our labour force. Unemployment has fallen in all regions of the country, and has been at the lowest level in many years. Canadians have benefited from good harvests and a high level of demand for our farm products.
The opportunities and the need for further sustained economic growth have been indicated by the Reviews of the Economic Council of Canada. My Government intends to pursue policies to ensure that our prosperity and growth continue. It is important that the benefits this can bring to all Canadians should not be jeopardized by excessive costs and prices which would endanger the stability of our economy. My Government therefore intends to continue its policy of stretching out its expenditure on public construction projects in areas of heavy pressure on the construction industry.
With a high rate of employment, our economic growth and living standards will depend increasingly on how successful we are in improving the performance of our economy. Our economic efficiency can be improved by concerted efforts to adapt and develop our institutions, both private and governmental, to our real needs. Improvements in the skills and efficiency of our existing working force, and of those entering the labour force will necessitate increasing emphasis on training, on education and in general on enabling and assisting our people to qualify for the best jobs available. We work and trade in a highly competitive world which offers many opportunities but demands the best performance. Improvements in productivity will permit our economy to grow faster and should enable us to achieve higher standards of living and a better balance in our international payments.
Banking legislation and related proposals will be placed before you.
A Bill will be placed before you to amend the Railway Act, which has been modified in the light of consideration in the last Parliament and public discussion in the intervening period. You will also be asked to consider a measure respecting the capital structure of the Canadian National Railways.
My Government attaches great importance to improving the technical capabilities of Canadian industry. The program for the advancement of industrial technology, introduced last year, is well under way and a number of important individual projects have already been initiated. You will be asked to approve legislation to encourage research and development, which will enlarge and improve upon the present taxation incentive. You will also be asked to enact legislation to establish a Science Council of Canada in order to encourage further the progress of scientific research.
My Government will propose a vigorous program, in co-operation with the provinces, to foster the training of workers and to assist in bringing into productive employment those who are now unemployed or inadequately employed. You will be asked to consider a measure to improve the system of training allowances provided under federal-provincial agreements.
You will be asked to approve the creation of a fund for financing major rural development projects and, in order to facilitate wide-ranging action for rural development, amendments to the legislation regarding agricultural rehabilitation will be placed before you.
In order that farmers of this country may enjoy living and working standards comparable with those of Canadians engaged in other occupations, measures designed to raise and safeguard farm incomes will be introduced. Among other measures, my Government will propose a program for the purchase, re-development and re-sale of farms that are not now viable economic units. You will be asked to consider a revision of the Crop Insurance Act, for the purpose of enabling crop insurance to be available to all farmers.
Legislation to establish a Canadian Dairy Commission will be placed before you. A measure will also be proposed to provide cash advances for unthreshed grain when weather conditions prevent full harvesting. You will be asked to approve legislation to improve the movement and marketing of feed grain in Eastern Canada and British Columbia by creating a livestock feed agency.
The heavy demand for loans from the Farm Credit Corporation make it desirable again to increase the capital of the Corporation.
In furtherance of the national fishery program, a measure for the development of the commercial fisheries of Canada will be proposed. You will also be asked to consider a proposal for income support for inshore fishermen in years of catch failure.
My Ministers will continue their efforts to promote Canada's trade through programs designed to bring this nation's existing resources and growing industrial capacities to the attention of the world, and through a full participation in international negotiations.
You will be asked to increase the ceiling for long-term export financing under the Export Credits Insurance Act, to facilitate the continued expansion of our export trade.
A resolution will be brought before you concerning the Canada-United States Agreement on Automotive Products, which my Government regards as one of the most important trading arrangements ever made between Canada and the United States.
You will be asked to approve legislation to establish a Canada Development Corporation. My Government is initiating consultation with the provinces for the improvement of securities legislation, and will propose a measure to improve the effectiveness of the Bankruptcy Act.
It is the intention of the Government that the work commenced by the joint committee on consumer credit in the last Parliament will be carried on in the new Parliament, and that a special committee of the House of Commons on food and drugs be again established.
My Government will continue to work for the effective co-ordination of measures to reduce poverty and increase security across Canada. In this respect, the Canada Assistance Plan is intended to enable the Provinces to provide, on a comprehensive and flexible basis, adequate assistance to individuals and families in need. Since the announcement of this measure by my Government early last year, satisfactory discussions have been held with all the provinces and legislation embodying the Government's proposals will be placed before you in this session.
It is the aim of my Government to provide young people with the opportunities they are seeking for constructive service to the community, at home and abroad, and to that end legislation will be placed before you for the establishment of a Company of Young Canadians.
In accordance with my Ministers' belief that public policy should be directed to ensuring that all Canadians can obtain needed health services, irrespective of their ability to pay, my Government last July announced its willingness to make fiscal contributions to provinces which provide programs of medical care meeting certain criteria. When discussions with the provinces have been sufficiently advanced, legislation to carry out this proposal will be placed before you.
To provide for the expected expansion of health services, my Government has announced its intention to establish a Health Resources Fund of $500 million. You will be asked to approve a measure establishing this Fund.
While fully respecting the jurisdiction of the provinces in matters of education, my Government recognizes a pressing obligation to foster more effective development of the human resources of Canada by assisting the expansion of institutions of higher education, and by providing greater and more equitable opportunities for young Canadians to attend such institutions. A program of Canada scholarships and bursaries for students undertaking higher education will be submitted for your approval. Amendments will be proposed to the Student Loans Act. As an initial response to the acute financial difficulties encountered by the universities and colleges, you will be asked to approve a substantial increase in the federal financial assistance to universities for the academic year 1966-67. After discussion with the provinces, my Government will convene a meeting to consider continuing action in a manner that recognizes differences in the educational systems and institutions of the provinces.
Legislation on unemployment insurance will be proposed. You will also be asked to consider measures respecting the Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act and Safety in Employment.
Arrangements will be made for you to decide the issue of capital punishment at an early date.
My Government intends to place before you legislation regarding Term 29 of the Terms of Union with Newfoundland.
My Government will propose legislation to amend the Canadian Citizenship Act, in order to ensure equality of rights for all citizens; legislation to make collective bargaining available to the Public Service; legislation revising federal superannuation and pension plans to integrate them with the Canada Pension Plan; legislation to remit to provincial governments 95 per cent of corporation taxes on investor-owned electric utilities a measure to help the development of a feature film industry in Canada; legislation to establish the National Arts Centre and measures respecting the National Gallery and Museums; the extension of the Export and Import Permits Act; and legislation to extend the construction period for the Trans-Canada Highway.
Other legislative proposals which you will be asked to consider will include amendments to the Judges Act, the National Energy Board Act, the Area Development Incentives Act, the Aeronautics Act, the Canadian Vessel Construction Assistance Act, the Yukon and Northwest Territories Acts, the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, the Atlantic Development Board Act, the National Housing Act, the
Appointment of Chairman Defence Production Act, and the Post Office Act. Further measures may be brought forward in the course of the Session as a result of inquiries now pending.

17,27,2,1967-05-09,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
As my words are being broadcast throughout Canada I should like to begin on a personal note. I
want to say that I am deeply conscious of the possibilities for good for Canada of my new office and duty-that which brings me here today to open the Centennial Session of Parliament. May I renew my pledge at the ceremony of Installation: that my sole purpose and effort will be to merit the confidence which had been reposed in me by Her Majesty our Queen on the advice of her Canadian Ministers and by the countless Canadians from every region who have so freely offered their good wishes. My wife and I are deeply grateful for such messages and greatly encouraged by them.
On this occasion we feel again the sadness of our loss in the recent death of His Excellency General Georges Vanier, my much beloved predecessor. His courageous and lifelong devotion to all that is good and honourable sets an example to inspire all Canadians.
The careers of my two distinguished Canadian predecessors have added to the traditional and constitutional functions of the Governor General as the representative of Her Majesty the Queen of Canada, that of representing the Canadian people in a broad range of their activities and attitudes. In this role I shall try to encourage the best features of our national life, in all its diversity, and to symbolize the unity and continuity of the Canadian people as expressed in their federal institutions.
With you, I look forward this summer to the visit of Her Majesty the Queen and other members of the Royal Family. The presence of our Sovereign and the Heads of State of other countries will bring added joy and festivity to our land as it celebrates the centennial of its Confederation.
This Centennial Session of Parliament provides an opportunity to begin to give effect to our aspirations for the second century of Confederation.
The weak colonies joined together in 1867 have grown today into a prosperous and dynamic country. That so much could have been accomplished in the face of great difficulties is a tribute to the courage, determination and faith in human progress of countless Canadian men and women of all origins. It is also a tribute to the wisdom and foresight of the Fathers of Confederation who created the constitutional framework without which much of this progress would have been impossible.
Our country was not founded in 1867. It is far more deeply rooted in time than that. But, one hundred years ago, our predecessors-men of many races, creeds and tongues-embarked upon a great exercise in statecraft of which we, today, are the trustees. They laid the foundations. They anchored them in a fundamental sense of unity that generations of conflict had taught was vital to the common weal. With this realization they erected a structure of government for the freedom, welfare, and prosperity of all who might come in time to inhabit this land. They built according to a federal plan because they knew that unity, with cultural and regional diversity could be harnessed to a positive and enriching role in no other way.
The concept of Confederation was a call to Canadians to occupy and develop half a continent. In terms of physical effort, it demanded constructive work of a magnitude and in the face of obstacles never before tackled anywhere in the world. In terms of intellectual endeavour, it required the revolutionary application of federal arrangements to a parliamentary system in a sparsely populated country of enormous area.
The path of Confederation has been beset with great difficulties-some natural, some inevitable and some of our own making. Succeeding generations of men and women, however, had the courage to overcome these difficulties and make possible the material and social progress we today enjoy. They had the conviction of their forefathers that a sense of basic unity alone would secure the preservation of both the individuality and the diversity which they cherished. They knew that, while Confederation could never be perfect, it was in the last analysis the mainstay of their various interests and that, while there would inevitably be occasional failures in the tolerance and understanding essential to our political system, a fundamental friendship between our people remained and could be relied upon. They Irnew, above all, that there was no difference of opinion so great, no misunderstanding so deep, that could prevent men of good will from repairing the particular in order to preserve the whole.
During the past one hundred years the world has changed beyond the recognition of anything within the experience of those who laid the foundations of Confederation. That our constitutional structure has endured and served so well the progress of our country is a measure of the basic soundness of its principles as well as the willingness of those concerned to adapt their application to changing needs and changing conditions.
It is in this spirit that the government has in recent years actively promoted the reform of detailed federal-provincial arrangements which, with the fundamental law, compose the constitutional structure of our country. Such reform includes improving procedures for federal-provincial consultation and coordination that are increasingly vital to the effective operation of modern government.
The government is aware of its unique responsibility to ensure that our fundamental law is readily adaptable to our changing social needs. It is also conscious that the advantages and disadvantages of the present constitutional structure are deeply intertwined. While orderly reform may well be the best way of preserving and strengthening our heritage, the most careful consideration must be given to what we do. Studies to obtain the best advice on this important matter are now underway with a view to subsequent consideration of the whole problem by Parliament.
It was possible to think, in 1867, of the public responsibility primarily in terms of state responsibility. The new challenges, which we must and will meet, require the involvement of the whole society and the efforts of all our people. In this time of fast-changing dimensions, the central concern of Canadian society must be the well-being of each individual, so that, regardless of his place or station at birth, he will have an equal chance to realize his full potential in the economic, social, political and cultural sense. A country is a home; it must be built and furnished for the good life of its people.
With our forefathers, the fight was against the immense odds of nature on our half of this continent. Today the main struggle is against social injustice, against cultural mediocrity, against spiritual stagnation and against all forms of intolerance.
During the first one hundred years of our Confederation we have been evolving, out of our bilingual and bicultural beginnings, an ideal of statehood that promises a new dimension of democracy: the dimension of social and cultural diversity within a political unity. Out of the two great cultural streams of our beginnings, we have evolved in Canada an independent statehood which has welcomed and been enriched by people of many other cultures. As we enter our second century of Confederation, we can take pride in a sense of purpose that, while taking account of our own national needs, also includes a unique capacity to contribute to the whole world community of man.
Today relations among industry, labour and governments at all levels are taking on a new significance. To maintain and improve Canada's economic strength it is necessary to exercise wisdom and restraint in our demands upon one another; to show a high degree of cooperation and a sense of responsibility in dealing with each other and with our respective institutions, including all levels of government.
The government is conducting a fundamental review of the many significant factors involved in the relationship between industry, labour and government. From this review, it will secure the best advice available in shaping new policies and determining the most effective day-to-day role for the federal government.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
As our Centennial Session opens, more Canadians are employed than ever before in our history. To ensure that jobs keep pace with the labour force, the capacity, quality and productivity of Canadian manufacturing industries must be increased. The government will take further appropriate measures to promote an environment in which industries can develop in the broad interests of the country, and promote increasing employment opportunities.
The government will also take special measures in particular designated areas where human resources are not adequately utilized. While efforts by the government in this regard during recent years have met with a large measure of success, they are to be made even more effective. Parliament, therefore, will be invited to broaden the scope of the Area Development Incentive program and to provide increased funds for it. Continuing encouragement will be given to the work of the Atlantic Development Board in promoting industrial development in the Atlantic Region.
Our strong and dynamic economy has made possible a broad program of social security which is available to all Canadians. Social legislation in Canada has been advanced to a remarkable degree in recent years. This does not mean to imply that all our programs are complete. Improvements will be required, such as the amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act, which Parliament will be invited to consider.
Parliament will also be asked to enact a measure further to assist Canadians when moving from their homes in order to obtain employment. This will be accompanied by administrative action to increase the effectiveness of Canadian manpower centres. A full service will be developed for counselling individuals looking for work and for helping all workers to take advantage of employment opportunities. At the same time the adult retraining program will be strengthened and, in consultation with the provinces, a number of pilot training projects will lay concrete plans for new approaches in manpower development.
While the government is conscious of the desirability of a greater degree of domestic control of our resources and our key industries it is also aware of the continuing importance of inflows of foreign investment in order to ensure an optimum development of the economy. To enable Canadians to gain a clearer understanding of these issues, a White Paper on this subject will be laid before Parliament.
The government attaches great importance to opening up new ways for the participation of our people in the ownership of our industrial institutions. You will therefore be asked to consider a bill to establish a Canada Development Corporation in order to further the industrial development and trade of this country by reinforcing the supply of Canadian equity capital ready to share the risks as well as the rewards of investment in Canadian business.
Federal-provincial cooperation through the Fund for Rural Economic Development will permit a major effort for regional planning for particular areas in Canada. Implementation of development projects in Northeastern New Brunswick, at Mactaquac in New Brunswick and the Interlake area of Manitoba will provide the Federal Government with tools of knowledge and experience for the benefit of other regions throughout the country. You will also be invited to approve the establishment, with the Government of Nova Scotia, of a Crown Corporation to phase out the uneconomic coal mining operations in Cape Breton, while creating alternative industrial employment.
Greater emphasis and encouragement, consistent with federal responsibilities, will be given to community development programs throughout Canada. In no case is the need for these more fully demonstrated than in the case of the Indians and Eskimos of Canada who face grave problems in their attempts to share the benefits and opportunities of our society. The government will therefore put before the Centennial Session amendments to the Indian Act and it will take other administrative measures to encourage the process of community development, for the benefit of the Indian and Eskimo people.
In foreign affairs Canada has put its major effort Into the pursuit of peace. Our diplomacy aims at strengthening Canada's position in the councils of nations so as to work towards that world peace and stability that is the agreed objective of all sectors of public opinion in this country.
The most serious situation in the world today remains that in Vietnam. The government continues to attach the highest priority to initiatives designed to bring about a peaceful settlement of this conflict and we will continue to exert every effort to this end through diplomatic and other peaceful means. The government is prepared to
cooperate in the establishment of an international presence in Vietnam to provide the assurances and guarantees which may have to form part of any settlement. We are also prepared to assist in the economic reconstruction and rehabilitation in that area once peace has been restored.
The government will also continue to press vigorously for effective international action in the field of disarmament. It regards curbing the nuclear arms race as a first and essential step on the road to general disarmament.
With these objectives in mind, Canada is joining with its NATO partners in a review of the future tasks of the alliance. Besides the changing requirements of collective defence, we will have in mind the progressively important political role which NATO has undertaken in the pursuit of a peaceful settlement in Europe.
The United Nations remains for Canada a major consideration in foreign policy. Until the end of 1968 Canada will have the responsibility of membership on the Security Council, and in that role the government will strive to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations fully to discharge its proper functions.
It is also expected that the ""Kennedy Round"" of International Trade and Tariff Negotiations will soon be completed in Geneva. In the light of its conclusions, you will be asked to approve changes in tariffs and related laws necessary to implement the undertakings Canada will give in order to gain improved access for Canadian products in export markets.
The government also intends to play an active part in the forthcoming meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, as it attaches great importance to the trade problems of less-developed countries.
Unless there is a concerted international endeavour to promote economic, technical and social advances in the developing countries, the world will soon face a major crisis. The advances painfully won by the nations of Asia, Africa and the Americas must not be lost through the lack of aid or through impediments to trade. Steps will be taken further to develop Canada's special relations with the Commonwealth countries of the Caribbean.
The government also intends to seek approval for a substantial increase in the external aid program, as a further step towards the aid target of one per cent of national income.
External aid, trade and the activities of a host of international agencies today bind the peoples of the world more closely together than ever before in human history. There is an international flavour to modern life that was unknown to all but a select few in years past, but which will become commonplace for people generally in the years ahead.
All this is dramatically demonstrated by Expo 67 which recently opened in Montreal and by the Pan American Games to take place in Winnipeg this summer. These are features of our Centennial party, to which the whole world has been invited. Expo provides an extraordinary opportunity to extend hospitality to those who join with us in celebrating the one hundredth anniversary of Confederation. It is attracting visitors to Canada in greater numbers than ever before, and provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to display our achievements to the rest of mankind. Our country will also be receiving an increasing flow of people who will remain with us, to add to the variety and strength of our country. You will be asked to consider a complete revision of our immigration legislation.
If the century that has passed can be characterized by the development of the resources of our land, it is likely that the century to come must be marked by an increasing concentration upon the development of the resources of the mind and the spirit.
The government has already embarked upon a number of programs to increase substantially the level of scientific innovation, but much information of potential use in upgrading the technological capability of our country is not being fully utilized. The government has therefore initiated a study which will lead to a program to provide for the efficient dissemination of the latest scientific and technological information throughout Canada. The government also intends to recommend substantial expansion in its assistance to science and technology in their broadest senses and to develop a climate conducive to more expenditure in this area by Canadian industry. Particular attention will be given to developing a climate of cooperation among governments, universities, and industries, that will provide effective solutions for the great problems associated with our environment: with health, transportation, energy, communications, housing and urban renewal, food production and many others that have particular relevance to this country.
The arts, humanities and social sciences also have an importance to our future that needs no elaboration. In recent years the government has taken vigorous action to ensure unprecedented support for those branches of learning essential to the enrichment of the spirit and to the government of men. More remains to be done so that there will be provided a host of challenging opportunities to Canadians of all ages: opportunities of the kind that will excite the interests of our best minds; opportunities that, accepted with spirit and vigour, can lead to progress of exceptional significance in the social and economic life of Canada.
Recognizing that broadcasting is an important cultural instrument the government supports a comprehensive and balanced national broadcasting service for Canadians of all ages, interests and tastes. Toward these ends a measure will be put before this Session for better regulation and use of broadcasting privileges and responsibilities. Legislation will also be placed before Parliament concerning the provision of broadcasting facilities for educational purposes.
The government is profoundly aware of the economic, social and cultural issues concerned in the development of satellite communications. Studies of this important matter are now underway and will be pressed to completion so that you may be thoroughly informed on all aspects when grave decisions as to use, ownership, regulation and control must be reached. A committee of Parliament will be invited to study the issues involved in this new means of communication.
In one form or another science is already reaching into the very heart of the community to transform the lives of each of us. It is essential that the control and development of our environment keeps apace. We have built towns and cities, canals and railroads, highways and other great works of construction at an unprecedented pace. But we have too often in the past made beauty the poor sister of material gain and careless workmanship the
price of easy profit. We must lose no more time in making ugliness in our environment as unwelcome as financial losses in our balance sheets.
One of the great challenges of the century will be our capacity to plan our urban development so that Canadians in the future will continue to enjoy the benefits of living in health and harmony with their surroundings. To this end, the government intends to propose to the provinces that a special study of urban development be undertaken in close consultation with all the authorities concerned, which would be available to the federal, provincial and municipal governments and to the public generally; so that all Canadians will be aware of problems which lie ahead and so that governments at all levels, will have the best possible advice to assist them in their own planning and in their respective contributions to this great problem.
You will be invited to consider new housing programs which, while recognizing the primary responsibility of the individual and the other levels of government in the provision of housing, will help to fill requirements that clearly lie ahead.
The impact of science, industrialization and urbanization and the changing conditions in Canada and abroad also demand that our agricultural goals and policies should be kept under continuous examination. The government, confident that Canada can look forward in its second century to continuing as one of the great agricultural countries of the world, proposes to establish a Special Task Force under the Minister of Agriculture. It will be charged with projecting agricultural goals for the future and recommending policies to meet these goals. A firm basis should thus be provided for the development, in full cooperation with the provinces, of a national agricultural policy. This national policy will be designed to bring greater returns to the efficient farmers of this country consistent with those of other segments of our economy and consistent with the contribution to our well-being that is made by the agricultural segment. At the same time plans will be developed that will permit the retraining of those who wish to leave the agricultural field.
The changing needs of rural communities also deserve special attention. During the present Session, you will be asked to approve legislation to provide long-term loans to agricultural and fisheries associations and corporations to permit them to develop facilities commensurate with the needs of such communities. The pattern of agriculture is changing and with the change there is increased need for capital to permit the development and maintenance of a competitive agricultural structure. Therefore you will also be asked to broaden the scope of the Farm Credit Act, in particular to enable young men and farmers' sons to develop or acquire efficient and viable production units.
The great natural resources that we take into our second century will be vital to us in meeting our needs and in maintaining our position as a major world trader. Measures will be introduced by the government at the present Session arising out of the need to conserve and preserve the great wealth with which Canada has been so richly endowed. Water itself is becoming a more and more valuable resource. Efforts to combat pollution are taking on an economic as well as a social significance and the federal government intends to press forward in cooperation with the provinces. In keeping with this objective, you will be asked to approve a new
Canada Water Act which will provide a framework for the improvement and implementation of Canadian water policy.
At the same time, the search for new resources hastens the opening of the North. Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the government of the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, and the government intends to undertake new incentives for industry and regional economic planning intended to strengthen the economy of the North.
The encouragement of scientific and intellectual endeavour, and the development of natural resources, will be of no great benefit to Canadian society in its second century of Confederation unless a concerted effort is made to bring about a better relationship between the individual and his government. The government therefore attaches great importance to administrative and law reform so as to assure the citizen an understanding and sense of identification with what is going on, the better to assure his support of and participation in the social institutions of our country. You will be asked to examine legal procedures and administration, not only with a view to their efficiency, but also as regards their simplicity and efficacy in so far as the individual citizen is concerned. Canada must set itself the task of developing a society in which every citizen can become an informed and real participant and plan a role to the measure of his wishes and abilities.
The Standing Committee of the House on Privileges and Elections will be asked to continue its study of the Report from the Committee on Election Expenses. When this study has been completed, the government will put forward proposals for your consideration.
You will be asked to consider reforms in our laws governing divorce. The government will also put forward a proposal concerning capital punishment. In all of these matters where decisions depend so much on personal judgement and belief, careful consideration will be given to procedures for handling them in Parliament. Early action will also be taken to seek other amendments to the Criminal Code.
In the highly complex society of today, the interests of the consumer must be taken fully into account in the formulation of government policy. It is abundantly clear that in the whole area of matters affecting the investor and the consumer, the federal government has special obligations arising out of its general responsibility for the economic well-being of the nation as a whole.
The rights of the consumer can be advanced through corporate and individual responsibility but they also impose an obligation on governments at all levels. At this Session government measures recommended for the promotion of consumer interests will include the designation of a department of corporate and consumer affairs. Within this department there will be created an organization responsible for developing new policies and coordinating programs undertaken within the federal government to assist the consumer and protect the small investor. It will also maintain liaison with the provinces in these fields.
The government also attaches great importance to the encouragement of more efficient allocation of capital resources and to the creation of a situation in which any Canadian can invest in companies
operating in Canada on the basis of comprehensive and accurate information. To this end, you will be asked to approve amendments to the Canada Corporations Act. They will ensure that federally incorporated companies are obliged to respect modern and high standards of financial disclosure and that their affairs are conducted in a way which will encourage a favourable investment climate.
Related to this is the improvement of the efficiency and stability of financial markets and institutions. Important changes were brought about in the last Session of Parliament with respect to banking legislation and the control of other financial institutions. The objective of the government is to encourage development of efficient financial institutions, with full regard for the public interest including the provision of adequate safeguards for depositors and investors. The government is prepared to exercise its responsibility in fields where it has jurisdiction. In these fields as well as in areas where jurisdiction is divided, it will seek to cooperate with all provincial governments.
Another matter of fundamental importance in our highly industrialized society is safety. The government proposes to review the whole area of its jurisdiction with respect to the setting and enforcement of safety standards in all the areas where they are required if the day-to-day life of the average citizen is to be adequately safeguarded.
As we observe this year the beginning of a new century of Confederation, we who find ourselves in positions of authority must always remember that it is our responsibility and our opportunity to serve the needs and aspirations of the Canadian people. Ours is a proud past. Together we in Canada have a future as promising as that of any other country in the world. But, above all, we are a people of the present. It is well that in giving thought to the goals of the second century of Confederation, we be aware that, as our success and promise of today rest on the actions of the past, so what we have tomorrow will depend on what we do today.
Members of the House of Commons,
The legislative program that the government proposes is large, and many of the issues it contains are complex. This has consistently been the case in recent years. It is a natural result of the growth and development of our country, the involvement of government in many matters, and the increasing technicality of modem society and the methods of its regulation. Parliament today requires virtually the full-time attention of its members, and this has been appropriately recognized. Likewise, you have recognized that the rules and methods of parliamentary government must be revised. In the last Session you established a Committee on the Rules of the House which made valuable progress in this regard. In this Session you will be asked to continue and expand that Committee's work. Canada in embarking upon its second century of federal government, must provide its Parliament with every facility to ensure that efficiency and thoroughness of deliberation which, in the consideration of every item of public business, is alone the sure protection of the liberty and well-being of our people.
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required for the services and payments authorized by Parliament.
Congratulations on Canadian Centennial Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
It is our honour and privilege to be responsible for the government of our country in this one hundredth year of confederation. It is our duty to govern well.
In addition to the measures already specified, you will be asked to consider a number of other legislative proposals.
In conclusion, I would end today, as the first Governor General of our country did one hundred years ago:
""Within our borders peace, security and prosperity prevail, and I fervently pray that your aspirations may be directed to such high and patriotic objects, and that you may be endowed with such a spirit of moderation and wisdom as will cause you to render the great work of union which has been achieved, a blessing to yourselves and your posterity, and a fresh starting point in the moral, political and material advancement of the people of Canada.""
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
18,28,1,1968-09-13,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I have the honour to welcome you to the first session of the 28th Parliament of Canada.
Across the land there are great expectations of what this Parliament will produce. My Ministers recognize the responsibility for leadership which these hopes entail. They are determined to do all that they can to carry out the mandate they received from the people of Canada in the recent general election. They recognize their duty to ensure that the wishes of Canadians concerning their Government be fulfilled as quickly and as completely as the general advantage will allow. At the same time my Government is conscious that aspirations and their realization have to be tempered by a sober awareness of reality. In the complexities of modern society, effective programs take time to
develop and more time to implement. At all stages they require financial and intellectual resources which are not unlimited and must be used with careful planning and the hard judgement of priorities. It is a simple fact of life that everything cannot be done at once.
My Government has planned the legislative program of this first session in the context of a Parliament of normal duration. To make way for the consideration in later sessions of new programs that Ministers are already developing, it is proposed, during the current session, to elucidate priorities and to set in motion new policies. Of equal importance, though of far less drama, Parliament will be asked to deal with a host of matters essential to the smooth and up-to-date functioning of government which were not disposed of in the previous Parliament. My Government considers that its first responsibility, and the first responsibility of this Parliament, is to clear the accumulation of essential legislative adjustments, improvements and modernizations left over from the last Parliament. Unless they are cleared up promptly, efficient public administration and the effective operation of the Canadian economy and society will be hampered.
My Ministers believe that much of the delay and difficulty in the handling of Parliamentary business during recent years could have been avoided or reduced by the improvement of Parliamentary rules and procedures. It is their view that Canadians feel that Parliament is too far removed from the people it serves; its operations are too slow and ponderous; its deliberations are often insufficiently informed and its decisions are too few and too much delayed. In order that Parliamentary institutions may retain the confidence of the people, and in order that they may cope successfully with the vast scope and complexity of government today, it is essential that provision be made for legislative machinery that can act speedily on the large number of varied, detailed and complicated legislative, financial and policy questions that will be the normal, and indeed the growing, Parliamentary program of the future. My Government accords the greatest importance to Parliamentary reform and, to this end and as a matter of the highest priority, it has already had useful discussions with representatives of Opposition parties concerning changes in the rules and procedures of the House of Commons.
So that the Official Opposition, to which we in Canada give formal recognition as a vital part of our democratic process, as well as the other parties in opposition, may be in a position to cope more effectively with the heavy load of action and decision each session must face, you will be asked to make new provision for the Official Opposition, and the other parties in their Parliamentary role. You will also be asked to consider additional facilities for the better discharge of the functions of Parliament generally.
My Government is deeply and irrevocably committed to the objectives of a just society and a prosperous economy in a peaceful world. My Ministers believe that the unity of the country is fundamental to the attainment of these goals, as-indeed-to the enjoyment by each Canadian of the maximum possible liberty, happiness x and material well-being. Constitutional reform remains the best long-term guarantee of Canadian unity and my Ministers are directing officials in discussions with the Provinces which are proceeding well and will, through a series of intergovernmental conferences, lead to proposals that Parliament will wish to consider. In the meantime, however, to further the objective of a united Canada, you will be asked during the current session, to enact a totally new Official Languages Act based on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. You will also be asked to approve a new Publication of Statutes Act to change the way in which the law of our bilingual land is presented and made known in both the official languages of our land. You will also be asked to consider measures relating to Indians, to citizenship, to national symbols, to cultural agencies, to transportation of all kinds as well as to communications (including satellites), educational television, and the financing of the Post Office.
Some of these proposals involve the righting of wrongs and others the opening of opportunities long denied. Together they exemplify the essential connection between justice and national unity. The attainment of a just society is the cherished hope of civilized men. While perhaps more difficult to formulate for groups than for individuals, even the members of majorities-political, religious, linguistic or economic-must know what it is to suffer injustice. My Government is deeply concerned to provide and to ensure increased justice, dignity and recognition to the individual, particularly in an age which is characterized by large governments, industrial automation, social regimentation and old-fashioned laws. A great deal has been accomplished in recent years to make the Canadian society more just in terms of income distribution and security against the vicissitudes of life. Pensions for the aged, provision for the sick and for the needy have been made more effective by legislation passed in recent Parliaments and by action of the provinces. Notwithstanding such measures, poverty continues to exist in Canada. My Government recognizes that, but it also believes that it would be deluding and cruel to pretend that there is a simple, all-encompassing or instantaneously effective remedy. Poverty can be dealt with successfully and permanently only by continued and determined action in a variety of ways by all governments. For its part, Parliament can be assured that the federal government will contribute fully and assume leadership wherever it can properly do so. To this end, the proposals you will have for your consideration will include the establishment of a department charged with the objective of ensuring that people in all areas and regions of our country have as equal access as possible to the opportunities of Canada's economic development.
At the same time, there are other and broader elements vital to a just society, and my Ministers feel that these must receive, at this and in later sessions of Parliament, a degree of attention they have not had hitherto. Toward these ends, you will be asked to enact important changes in the Criminal Law, to provide new protections for consumers and investors, to up-date food, drug and health legislation, to revise or amend legislation relating to the machinery of justice, and to correct a number of particular injustices, including those resulting from certain provisions of the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act. During the course of the present session it is anticipated that the government will receive reports from 
inquiries with regard to labour legislation and veterans pensions, and it is the intention of my Ministers to bring their proposals in these matters before you as soon as possible.
My Government believes that the objective of a just society must always include the pursuit of a prosperous economy as well as the fair distribution of its proceeds. Just as we have in the past tended, perhaps, to consider justice in our society largely in material terms, so we must recognize that there has been a tendency in Parliament and to some degree in Government to concentrate on the distributive aspects of our economy. In this course we have sometimes tended to neglect those aspects that can affect the productivity of our country, and hence the total provision of economic well-being for our society, and its competitiveness in the changing conditions of the modern world. The natural resources of Canada and the industries based upon them continue to be of immense importance to our economy but the advantages of our great physical resources by themselves are no longer an adequate base for a growing and prosperous modern economy. We shall increasingly have to compete on even terms with those countries of the world which are most advanced technologically in the provision of the sophisticated products of modern life. Unless Canada can maintain an economy that is efficient, competitive and productive in relation to the most advanced nations on earth, we cannot have the basis for a society from which poverty has been eliminated, we cannot maintain high levels of employment and income and we cannot ensure the standard of life to which Canadians generally aspire. It is against this background, as well as with the consciousness that the interests of all must be fairly balanced, that the government is approaching its policies and programs of an economic character. In this same context, Parliament will be asked during the present session to consider proposals for a systematic and continuous review of prices and costs in our economy.
Just as incomes cannot increase faster than productivity if price increases are to be restrained, so government spending by all levels of government cannot increase faster than productivity if we wish to restrain the increase in levels of taxation. These two realities are among the most important that Canadians and their leaders must bear in mind during the months and years ahead. Measures that you will have to consider relating to the Kennedy Round reflect the outcome of a major international effort to reduce the barriers to international trade and emphasize the opportunities opening up for a great trading nation like Canada. A measure to be brought before you dealing with the amendment of the Bretton Woods arrangements, results from comparable efforts to stabilize and improve the whole international financial system.
Conscious of the limitations it must place on its expenditures, my Government has acted within the framework of previously announced guidelines to select carefully the programs which in the light of regional needs and opportunities it considers most promising for the promotion of a prosperous economy. My Ministers will bring before you legislation relating to the encouragement of manpower programs, regional improvements, domestic investment, export development, and resource administration, including a Yukon Mineral Act and an Oil and Gas Production Act relating to Canada's increasingly
important northern resources. In addition, my Government will propose a Freshwater Fish Marketing Act, and intends to investigate immediately a number of methods for promoting greater efficiency in the production and marketing of grains, including the establishment of a National Grains Council. You will be asked to approve amendments to the Farm Improvement Loans Act, the Farm Credit Act, the Farm Machinery Syndicates Act, the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act, and the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act. You will be asked to consider a Canada Development Corporation Act, a Federal Cooperatives Act and an Export Development Corporation Act.
The growth of our population and the changes in the nature of our mobile urban and industrial society lend a new importance to conservation in its traditional sense. We have taken and are taking effective strides toward economic conservation through progressively better use of our resources to achieve a high and long-term productivity. We must also give new attention before it is too late to the preservation of our natural heritage for the enjoyment of Canadians of future generations. You will be asked to consider measures concerning National Parks and Historic Sites and Monuments. These and other facilities for the repose of the mind and restoration of the spirit, for sport, and for physical relaxation are and will be of increasing importance to our social environment. They offer Canadians and to visitors to Canada the possibility of a quality of life richly satisfying and ever more difficult to come by in this and in other industrial countries. Of broader importance is the problem of pollution, which must receive increased attention from federal, provincial and municipal governments. My Ministers are actively engaged in preparing proposals on these subjects and, in due course, these will be brought before you for your examination.
The natural riches with which Canada is blessed must serve to remind us that we have a substantial responsibility and a great opportunity in matters of foreign aid. My Government intends to press forward its plans and programs for international cooperation and development which include the establishment in Canada of an International Development Centre.
In international affairs generally, my Ministers regard the current situation as uncertain and deeply disturbing. Talks are under way in Paris concerning Vietnam but so far negotiations have not advanced as we had hoped they might. The Government has followed with anxiety the attempts to promote a peaceful settlement in Nigeria and has participated actively in international efforts to relieve the sufferings of the civilian population. The situation in Czechoslovakia has also caused the gravest concern to the government, not only for its effects on the prospects of detente and future evolution within Communist countries, but also for its consequences for the freedom and well-being of the Czechoslovak people. For those of them who have to seek refuge in other countries, my Ministers have already taken steps to offer permanent homes in Canada.
The Government has undertaken and is pursuing a thorough review of our external and defence policies. Canada's contribution to NATO, relations with Peking, with Latin America and with Europe
are being studied currently. Reviews of our relations with other areas will be undertaken later and, as conclusions are reached, Parliament will be invited to consider them.
The events in other lands to which I have referred are a vivid reminder that our gocJ fortune as Canadians includes rights and freedoms as well as material advantages. They alert us to the need, not only for vigilance in the conservation of our democratic institutions, but also to the importance of constant concern for their improvement. Efficient government, responsive to public requirements and open to public participation, is essential to the meaningful operation of the democratic process. It will be the more vital in the future as technology and science provide new and more immediate means for the dissemination of information and for the involvement, as individuals, of all our people. The Government has already taken steps to review its information services in order to introduce, as soon as possible, improvements by which the flow of information into and out of the government will be more efficient and effective, permitting the people of Canada a continuing, informed, and more active participation in the activities of their government. In addition, as part of the continuing process of modernization and development of governmental machinery, you will be asked during the current session to enact a Government Organization Act. This measure will complete a number of changes in organization and structure announced by the Prime Minister some weeks ago and will complement the Parliamentary reforms so fundamental to the successful operation of our democratic institutions.
The reinforcement and renovation of Parliamentary and administrative machinery and the clearing away of the substantial backlog now outstanding in the legislative program, will free Parliament so that it can come to grips with difficult and pressing problems relating to youth, poverty, regional disparities, urban growth, individual welfare, and the application and encouragement of scientific technology. These subjects are of concern to all governments in Canada and it is clear that a great deal more has to be done than has so far been contemplated. It would be wrong, however, to expect solutions to be found easily or indeed to be found at all except on the basis of close cooperation in good faith between federal, provincial and municipal governments not only in planning but in implementation as well.
To assist in this process it would be useful to have available to all governments an institute where long-term research and thinking can be carried out into governmental matters of all kinds. At the present time there is no such facility available in this country and it is the intention of my Ministers to bring before you in the near future legislation that will fill this most important gap in our governmental apparatus.
Members of the House of Commons:
During the current session you will be asked to appropriate the funds required for the services and payments authorized by Parliament. In addition to this business, the legislative program that the Government proposes is very extensive but many of the items have been seen before or are of an uncontroversial nature. A list of the Bills relating to the matters to which I have referred will be tabled by the Prime Minister later this day and
other portions of the program will be brought forward as the session proceeds. It is very important to the proper government of the country in the years ahead that the proposals for the current session be dealt with. In Canada as in other countries of the world democracy today faces a decisive challenge. It must adapt to new circumstances and new demands or fail in its purpose. This challenge is not abstract but a confrontation which you will have to face by virtue of your election to this Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
19,28,2,1969-10-23,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I have the honour to welcome you to the Second Session of the 28th Parliament of Canada and to present, on behalf of the Government, various matters which it wishes to lay before you.
Before doing so, may I say that, notwithstanding some unresolved problems which affect our collectivity, and notwithstanding the fears of people of little faith, it was encouraging to find, in the course of recent visits which my wife and I have made to Canadians in all ten Provinces and in the Arctic Islands, that their sense of identity, and of the potential which Canada offers to them and to their children, is strong and healthy.
I was also pleased to make a goodwill tour of the four Commonwealth countries of the Caribbean: Jamaica, Guyana, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. These visits abroad were made on the advice of the Government and with the encouragement of Her Majesty.
May I say, too, that Her Majesty's interest in Canada, and in Canadians and their affairs, will bring the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh to Manitoba and to the Northwest Territories in July of next year to join in the celebration of their centennials.
Canada is a fortunate country, blessed by nature and spared by war, but we are not immune from the effects of conflicts in other parts of the globe. Our world has become so compact, so interdependent, that all humanity is wounded by an outbreak of violence in any corner of the earth. Whether it be in Vietnam, Nigeria, or the Middle East, suffering in any part of the world disturbs the whole international community and affects Canada as a responsible member of that community.
Although we must be aware of the effects of these upheavals on our own country, we are even more concerned about the damage inflicted on the prospects for world peace and the spread of misery and deprivation. The means at our disposal for bringing these conflicts to an end are necessarily limited, but the Government is making full use of its opportunities to help reduce international tension.
We will continue to be an active member of the United Nations. After a quarter of a century of radical changes in its functions and membership, the U.N. needs to be revitalised and strengthened. Canada is presenting its proposals for reform to the present session of the General Assembly.
As weapons become more destructive and weapons' testing more dangerous, the Government is assigning a higher priority to its efforts in the field of arms control. One barrier to a ban on underground nuclear tests has been the difficulty
Speech jrom the Throne of verifying that it is being observed. As a practical step towards such a ban, Canada has proposed an international exchange of seismic information.
As long as differences between peoples are permitted to degenerate into hatred and violence, we cannot remain unmoved by appeals for help from the victims of wars. At the International Red Cross Conference last month, the Canadian Government gained acceptance of a principle which it has long supported whereby the Red Cross will be permitted to provide relief during civil wars to civilians on both sides.
In addition to our work in international organizations, we are intensifying our direct contacts with many of the governments and peoples of Latin America, Africa and Asia. At this session you will be asked to consider a bill to create a Canadian International Development Research Centre which will bring together Canadian and foreign experts on the problems of developing economies.
A disturbing element in many countries of the world has been the rising tide of unrest, particularly among young people. It has expressed itself in many ways, in public debate, in peaceful protest and sometimes in violence. Our profound disapproval of the excesses must not blind us to deeply felt and legitimate aspirations. Many citizens in our own country believe that they are entitled to assume greater responsibility for the destiny of our society. Such demands, insofar as they do not conflict with the general welfare, are the expression of a truly democratic ideal. They must be satisfied if our society is to attain its goals of peace and justice.
The Government believes that the time has come to extend the franchise in federal elections and it will therefore recommend to the Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections of the House of Commons that the voting age be lowered to eighteen.
Changes will be proposed in the legislation governing the Northern Territories which will improve the representational character of their Councils.
If the rights and interests of individuals and groups are to be safeguarded, they must be accurately reflected in the political structure of this country and in its basic blueprint, the Constitution.
The Government therefore attaches the greatest importance to the revision of the Constitution and to the progress achieved by the Constitutional Conference. The last meeting of the Conference provided an opportunity for particularly productive discussions, and the Government is determined to spare no effort to ensure the success of this vital task.
History, geography and economics have placed certain of our citizens at a disadvantage. Under legislation enacted during the last session of Parliament, the Government is establishing programs to reduce these inequalities.
The Official Languages Act, which provides for the use of French and English in federal government institutions wherever the composition of the population justifies it, will permit the exercise of essential language rights within a society which recognizes and welcomes a rich diversity of race, religion and cultural traditions.
This resolve to achieve linguistic equality will have its counterpart in social and economic life. During the last session, Parliament enacted legislation which will enable the Government, with the
co-operation of the Provinces, to set up programs to reduce regional disparities in employment opportunities and average incomes. In fact, despite the general cutback in its expenditures, the Government, recognizing the overriding urgency of these programs, has decided to allocate an increasing proportion of its revenues to them.
The necessity for raising the level of employment of Canadians of Indian descent and other less favoured citizens will also receive special attention.
Changes in the patterns of need in our society call for a more equitable social policy which will offer assistance and security to people unable to work or to provide for themselves and their families. A white paper on social security will be presented together with a proposal concerning the reorganization of the unemployment insurance program.
Satisfactory relations between labour and management are of critical importance to our social and economic progress. The Government is devoting greater attention to the problems and possibilities of industrial relations and will be putting forward for your consideration amendments to the legislation governing collective bargaining in the industries within federal jurisdiction.
There are many obstacles to be overcome if we are to achieve our economic goals, but inflation is undoubtedly the most serious and the most difficult to control. If we fail to control it, the consequences could rapidly prove disastrous, especially-but not only-for those whose incomes are already low.
In recent months the Government has urged both the public and the private sectors to adopt special measures to combat the dangers of inflation. These measures, which the Government has itself adopted, must be applied by all if further restraints are to be avoided.
You will also be called upon to study proposals for tax reform aimed at a fairer distribution of the tax burden combined with favourable conditions for growth in the national economy. The structure of our tax system must be adapted to reflect more accurately the true circumstances of individual Canadians and of business organizations in our modem society.
One of Canada's most valuable assets is undeniably the richness and variety of her material resources. In some cases, production has increased substantially and outstripped demand; grain is one of the commodities of which reserves have piled up, causing financial hardship to a good many farmers.
Increasing production of grain in many countries has contributed to a decline in our international grain trade and in world grain prices. This reduction of markets and prices has been of utmost concern to the Government, which intends to continue its search for new outlets for Canadian grain and its efforts to improve international co-operation and to re-establish orderly marketing. In addition, you will be asked to consider amendments to the Canada Grain Act which are intended to make our products more competitive in world markets.
The competitive position of Canadian fisheries must also be strengthened, not only through new licensing and marketing arrangements, but also by extending Canada's exclusive fishing zones.
Our resources are immense, but they are not inexhaustible. Although we must encourage their
development, we must also conserve them and regulate their use. Water is among the most precious of these resources. The evidence of past failure to rehabilitate our water resources is there for all to see-befouled water, despoiled beaches, rotting marine vegetation, and diminished fishing. The Government has made known its views on this serious problem, and has begun urgent discussions with the Provinces. Upon their completion, the Government will introduce legislation which will enable it, in co-operation with the Provinces, to improve and preserve our water resources. Thus may we assure ourselves of their continuing benefit for our own domestic use, industrial expansion, and recreation.
While the Atlantic and the Pacific retain their traditional importance for Canada, the Arctic Ocean and its coastal regions may soon enter a period of rapid economic development. Much of this development will undoubtedly occur on the islands of the Canadian archipelago, or in the adjoining continental shelf whose resources, under international law, we have the exclusive right to explore and exploit. With resource development, and the benefits it entails, may come grave danger to the balance of plant and animal life on land and in the sea, which is particularly precarious in the harsh polar regions. While encouraging such development, we must fulfil our responsibility to preserve these areas, as yet undespoiled and essentially in a state of nature. The Government will introduce legislation setting out the measures necessary to prevent pollution in the Arctic Seas. It is also considering other methods of protecting Canada's ocean coasts.
Through the United Nations and its agencies Canada is seeking to establish a system to combat the pollution of international waters which threatens so many forms of life on this planet.
Our aim is a strong and productive country soundly equipped to face the future; but we are equally concerned with the individual Canadian, his rights and his interests. The Government regards national progress and individual fulfilment as indivisible components of its mandate.
The size, complexity and fallibility of the structures that technology imposes on modern societies are often in conflict with the protection and development of individual values. The workings of both private and public institutions may endanger the individual's free expression of his unique personality. He must therefore be protected from anything that jeopardizes his rights or limits his personal development.
To this end, Criminal Code amendments will be submitted to you that would regulate wire-tapping and other invasions of the individual's privacy, and reform the present law governing detention before trial. Bills will be submitted to make federal tribunals more accessible and responsive, and to ensure fair treatment in expropriation cases. There will also be a bill to create a national law reform commission, whose task will be the improvement and modernization of the law and its administration at the federal level.
You will also be asked to review the large body of legislation applying to companies and financial institutions. To enhance the position of the consumer in the market place, the Government will ask you to augment our body of consumer protection. There will be proposals dealing with consumer credit, packaging and labelling, identification
Speech from the Throne of the fibre content of textile products and motor vehicle safety.
In the field of housing, despite the difficulties of inflation, the objective is to construct one million new housing units in five years. The Government will play its part in achieving that objective while emphasizing measures to satisfy the needs of low income families. This and related programs will stimulate social progress, employment, economic growth and urban improvement. They are a recognition of the need for every citizen to live in healthy and pleasant surroundings.
I have mentioned some of the important subjects of legislation which you will be asked to consider at this session. You will also be invited to discuss a number of aspects of long range national policy.
In addition to solving her immediate problems, Canada must be prepared to face the coming challenges of the post industrial era. This calls for a systematic appraisal of Canadian society and of the basic principles that are to guide it. During the past twelve months, the Government has begun this lengthy task. During this session a number of reports and white papers will be presented as part of a comprehensive revision of Government policy. You will thus be invited to examine the Government's findings concerning external affairs, defence, tax reform, citizenship, social security, information, and postal service.
In these documents the Government will define its goals and the means by which it proposes to achieve them, but it believes there is also a need for informed public discussion before bills are drafted in their final form, and before any far-reaching measures are taken.
A more intensive consideration of national policies by Parliament is in keeping with the spirit of the recent reforms in the rules of the House of Commons. These new rules will demonstrate that Parliamentary traditions can adapt to the changed circumstances of contemporary life while continuing to respect the fundamental principles of popular representation.
They are evidence of our common desire to modernize our institutions so that they will satisfy the needs and aspirations of our citizens, and thus enable us to work together in harmony and with renewed energy to ensure the progress and greatness of Canada.
Members of the House of Commons:
During this session, you will be asked to grant the necessary funds for the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
The Prime Minister will lay before you today a list of bills that will be submitted to you during the session.
May Divine Providence enlighten your deliberations."
20,28,3,1970-10-08,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I have the honour to welcome you to the Third Session of the 28th Parliament of Canada and to present, on behalf of my Government, various matters which it wishes to lay before you.
Before proceeding, I should like to recall to your minds a few events of the year which have been of special significance in our national life.
The Northwest Territories, which comprise 40 per cent of our land and water, and the ""Keystone"" Province of Manitoba, have each celebrated the one hundredth anniversary of their entry into Canada.
They were greatly encouraged in these exercises, and Canada as a whole was delighted by the presence of our gracious Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh, accompanied for the first time by The Prince of Wales and Princess Anne. The Royal Family travelled extensively in the Northwest Territories and visited a great many Manitoba communities, ending with an enthusiastic send-off from Winnipeg. In Ottawa we were all pleased to play host for two days to Prince Charles, a friendly and interested guest.
The interest of Canada as a whole in these centennials was shown in many ways, including a Session of the Cabinet in Winnipeg, individual visits by the Prime Minister and other Canadians in public life, and by the participation of my wife and myself.
Our own travels in the Western Arctic and in the Yukon Territory enabled us to round out our tours of all the Provinces and Territories.
Next year British Columbia, which extended the Canadian Federation to the Pacific Coast in 1871, will mark the centennial of this historic event. It will give Canadians much satisfaction to know that Her Majesty and The Duke of Edinburgh, accompanied by Princess Anne, will visit the Province in early May and join in the centennial celebration.
We gather here today within a few hours of the conclusion of the Second Session of this Parliament. In a real sense, the interval between the second and third sessions cannot be measured in terms of hours or days. The Third Session of the 28th Parliament commences in the decade of the seventies, a decade which we dare not assume will be a continuation of the past. The passing of the sixties and the beginning of the seventies reminds us that Canada faces a new age: an age which will be subject to forces not all of which are yet comprehended or understood, forces which will proceed from external as well as internal origins. It is a new age not so much because of changed circumstances, but new because of changed values and attitudes.
Because of the clash between these new values and the old, because of the quest by the young and the disillusioned for some resolution of attitudes, we live in a period of tenseness and unease. It is an age frequented by violence as desperate men seek ill-defined goals; an age of frustration as gentle men question impatiently old assumptions. It is an age in which the life-support systems of the biosphere may collapse unless man reverses his present course and begins again to live in harmony, rather than in competition, with his environment. It is an age in which the forces of science and technology now in motion are so massive, so swift, and so comprehensive that man may be facing his last opportunity to control his own destiny rather than be subject to it.
The decade of the seventies extends beyond our present vision, yet the momentum of change is already so overwhelming that man can no longer afford the luxury of reacting to events. He must anticipate and plan. He must accept that contentment and indifference are illusory; that the most dramatic reality is change; that there is more need than ever before to preserve as constant values truth, honesty, excellence and relevance; that a society which is not inspired by love and compassion is not worthy of the name.
We are entering an age of tension, an age of challenge, an age of excitement. At the threshold of the seventies a choice is open to Canadians as it is open to few persons in few countries. With foresight and stamina and enterprise, ours may be, if we wish it;
-a society in which human differences are regarded as assets, not liabilities;
-a society in which individual freedom and equality of opportunity remain as our most cherished possessions;
-a society in which the enjoyment of life is measured in qualitative, not quantitative terms;
-a society which encourages imagination and daring, ingenuity and initiative, not coldly and impersonally for the sake of efficiency, but with warmth and from the heart as between friends.
As Canada moves into the seventies, we are all invited to join in this bold enterprise-to share the excitement, to face the challenge, to pursue the distant ideal of a just society.
The Canada of the seventies must continue to be a land for people; a country in which freedom and individualism are cherished and nurtured; a society in which the Government lends its strength to withstand, rather than support the pressures for conformity.
One of the greatest of the challenges to individuality comes from the increasing pressures of urban living. It is estimated that eighty per cent of the population of Canada will be resident in a few large cities by the end of this century. By comparison with the recent past, this is a new face of Canada bringing with it a new accumulation of problems. One of those problems is the need for adequate housing, another the provision of the many services necessary in an urban environment. Much progress has already been attained in these areas, but much more remains to be done. To solve the problems will require an ever-increasing share of the nation's financial resources; not to solve them, to permit unmanaged growth, would result in an unacceptable drain of the nation's human resources. To foster coordination of the activities of all levels of government, and to contribute to sound urban growth and development, the Government proposes the re-organization of its urban activities under the direction of a Minister of State for Urban Affairs and Housing. The Government seeks, by making rational its efforts in these fields, and through consultation with those most directly concerned, to help Canadians reach and implement the decisions that will determine their urban future.
There exists in Canada a great wealth of untapped and uncoordinated scientific talent and experience not now adequately utilized in the quest for solutions to our modern problems. In order to serve better the industrial and technological sectors of our economy, as well as Canada at large, a programme will be introduced to gather and focus these sometimes divergent and competitive scientific resources. In this respect the Government will consider with care measures recommended by the Senate Committee on Science Policy and the Science Council of Canada.
A society is said to be judged best by the compassion and the fairness with which it treats those of its members who breach or are accused of breaching the norms of conduct which it establishes for itself. The Canadian record in this respect is of a high standard, but not so high that it can withstand all criticism. You will be asked, therefore, to consider further measures intended to continue the reform of the law in these areas. Legislation has been prepared which deals with bail and pretrial detention, and with the treatment of young offenders.
Norms of conduct are never static, however, and certainly not at present. A society which cherishes the concept of freedom of individual rights must be prepared constantly to assess the effect and extent of changing attitudes, no matter how distressing or disturbing the re-evaluation may be to some persons. Previously accepted postures are under attack in Canada and require study in several areas. The Government accepts its responsibility in this process. The report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs, expected within the next few months, will require careful study and discussion. The Government proposes to make time available during
this session for discussion of still another controversial issue. It proposes a special debate on abortion.
To ignore the undoubted widespread challenges to present laws in these fields would be dishonest. You will be invited, therefore, to participate, in the examination of these important questions. You will be asked as well to give consideration to the report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women when once this is received.
Fortunately, not all aspects of Canadian life are subject to such differences of opinion, and the need for legislation in certain sectors is widely recognized. Two such sectors, immense in size and largely overlapping, are those of the consumer and the employee. Every Canadian is a consumer of goods and services, millions of Canadians are employees. To face today's competitive marketing system, the consumer requires protection in a number of respects. Measures will be introduced, therefore, to protect Canadians more adequately from the results of combines, mergers and unfair trade practices, to regulate the labelling and packaging of consumer goods, and to protect further the users of consumer credit.
Because the Canadian work force is growing in size and sophistication, and operating within an increasingly integrated industrial environment, present measures must be amended to meet changing social requirements. You will be asked, therefore, to approve a revised legal framework for labour-management relations and a new set of labour standards for industries within federal jurisdiction. Sweeping changes in the field of unemployment insurance will be proposed in a bill designed to widen considerably both the benefits offered and the persons who are qualified to take advantage of them. These measures will make more rational and more fair the assistance available to those temporarily without employment. The legislation is a product of the careful study of this subject tabled in Parliament last session in the form of a white paper.
A number of other studies of this same nature have been underway in past months as well. These reflect Government planning for the Canada of the seventies. Parliament will be invited to examine in this session a number of white papers in such diverse fields as communications, citizenship, immigration, national defence, and income security policy.
The Government is pleased at the widespread and largely constructive public response to its invitation to comment upon the proposals contained in its white paper on tax reform. The views of those who have participated in this exercise are being examined and carefully considered, as will those of the two Parliamentary Committees. Thereafter, legislation will be introduced incorporating policies designed to make more equitable the economic burden shared by our fellow dwellers in this complex and varied land. These taxation measures are part of the Government's pledge to utilize the wealth of Canada for the good of all Canadians and not just for those fortunate enough to be shielded by the protective apparatus of giant corporations, alert professional organizations or powerful labour unions.
It remains the goal of the Government to be concerned with the production of wealth. It also remains the goal of the Government that Canadians be given the opportunity to enjoy that wealth. Income security programmes offer one means by which this latter goal can be attained. To this end legislation will be introduced.
All our efforts for a stable prosperity and for a humane community will be of little value to us, however, if we do not quickly and determinedly grapple with the threat to our well-being and the well-being of future generations of Canadians which is represented by environmental pollution. Pollution is a many-headed hydra and requires action in many forms. You will be asked to consider bills intended to deal with pollution in two of its aspects: in the ocean and in the atmosphere. More pressing than any single step or steps, however, is the need to co-ordinate and consolidate our efforts in an effective fashion. There will be proposed the establishment of a department to be concerned with the environment and the husbanding of those renewable resources that are a part of and dependent upon it, with a mandate for the protection of the biosphere.
However worthy our goals, and however strong our will to attain them, they will nevertheless be denied to us in whole or in part should our economy be malfunctioning. It would be irresponsible to suggest that the economy is now in a satisfactory condition. When costs rise more rapidly than productivity, when men and women are unable to gain employment, when a reasonable distribution of the wealth of Canada is denied to certain sectors or regions, then these are matters for deep concern. Fortunately, our population, the number of Canadians engaged in productive employment, the total volume of goods and services which they produce, and Canadian exports all continue to grow.
Export sales of grains, so important to Canada's economic well-being, are exhibiting a steadily rising trend in marked contrast to the very stagnant situation a year ago. The LIFT program has removed a substantial portion of the accumulated wheat surplus which was inhibiting the international wheat market, and has encouraged a healthy diversification of agricultural activities. The unanimous support accorded the Gov-erment's initiative in the development of national marketing agencies by the First Ministers at their recent meeting assures continued cooperation between both levels of government. That cooperation will provide a basis for improved marketing structures for agricultural commodities, which will benefit both producers and consumers in almost all segments of agricultural endeavour. The Government will continue to introduce programmes designed to improve the market potential for agricultural produce and to assist in the adjustment to changes in this vital sector of our economy.
Canadian industry is responding to the challenges of growth and of adaptation to a changing world environment. Our exports in past months have achieved record heights. In an attempt to place the textile industry on a competitive footing, legislation to facilitate adjustment of that industry will be introduced this session.
We are not yet free of inflationary pressures but there has been real progress and price increases have abated to the extent that the Canadian record in the battle against inflation is superior to that so far attained in any other western country. In the result it has been possible for the past several months to moderate certain monetary and fiscal restraints. Unemployment remains distressingly high in some parts of Canada although the rate has not increased significantly in recent months, and measures to encourage regional economic expansion in areas of slower development are beginning to show results. Soundly based growth, which is prerequisite for increased permanent employment opportunities, will continue to be encouraged and will reflect success to the extent that restraint is exercised by all Canadians in the cost area, and that improved productivity strengthens the position of Canada in external trade.
In sum, the vitality of the economy, coupled with present governmental policies, is countering slowly but effectively the pressures of inflation and unemployment. So long, however, as Canadians who desire work are unable to find it; so long as persons on fixed incomes are unable to provide adequately for themselves and their dependents; then so long must the Government strive to assist them.
It must do so even as it acknowledges and weighs the concern expressed increasingly by Canadians about the extent and the nature of foreign ownership in the Canadian economy. Legislation dealing with one aspect of this complex problem, the uranium industry, will be introduced for your consideration.
All these matters require your earnest consideration even as the events of the world beyond our borders demand our constant attention. Canadians have long realized that they represent but a single segment of a larger world community. The political, economic and social health of Canada cannot be maintained should infection of either a primary or secondary nature be rampant in the world at large. The Government continues, therefore, to direct its efforts in increasing measures to those tasks where Canadian initiative and Canadian competence may prove to be as effective as has other Canadian enterprise in the past. Much of this effort is expended within the framework
Speech from the Throne
of the United Nations, celebrating this year a quarter century as the conscience and the hope of mankind. In such diverse but important fields as disarmament, environmental protection, economic development planning, the creation of new international legal structures for the deep oceans and outer space, and international security, we work and remain committed to a world in which peace, social progress and the dignity of man will be the norm and not the exception as is now too often the case.
An economy that is in need of adjustment; a society beset by a variety of tensions; an environment that has been abused and degraded; an international community that is under intense pressures-these are the problems that demand our urgent attention. But of those that are basically Canadian, none is insoluble. None takes the form of those dilemmas or irreconcilable issues which elsewhere fire the violence of despair. Notwithstanding its difficulties, Canada continues to enjoy social stability to an exceptional degree.
This stability is not simply a matter of luck. Good fortune is a factor, but we should accept gracefully the fact that we are also more amenable to reason and, perhaps, more capable of wise decision than we are normally willing to admit. The burden of our European inheritance and our fascination with our American neighbour tend often to distract us and cause us to be unaware of that reasonableness and that wisdom. We forget to our own disadvantage, for these are traits that have made Canada a land of freedom. Canadians should pause on occasions such as this to reflect that their country is regarded by others with envy. It is a high place of liberty in the world. It is held in esteem because in Canada respect is paid to the individual; privacy and freedom of thought are honoured. Among us, each citizen, each community, finds its roots in liberty. Our national entity does not depend upon a melting pot, but is a concerted exercise of free will.
It is in this sense of liberty as a supreme value, and of tolerance as its social and political expression, that we find our foundation and strength as a people. Let us recognize with pride and with modesty what so many strangers admire and see in us: that we have achieved greatly, that in the future even greater achievements are within our reach. We have the capacity, if we retain the will, to adjust our society to reflect the values of our peoples, to benefit from a rich cultural life, to create viable political and social structures, and to strike an equilibrium with nature without which all the rest may be undone.
The conviction is growing throughout the world that if man is to survive he must strive without delay to regulate his future. This is a task which presupposes a fullness of freedom and an extensive field of human experience. Now, as we enter the decade of the seventies, Canada is free enough, vast enough, and diversified enough to undertake this task which is so vital and which will have such world-wide effects. Should we not lose our will or our nerve, this task can be accomplished and could prove to be the principal element of the Canadian fact. We stand on the threshold of greatness.
Members of the House of Commons:
During this Session, you will be asked to grant the necessary funds for the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
The Prime Minister will lay before you today a list of bills that will be submitted to you during the Session.
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
21,28,4,1972-02-17,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
This reunion of your two Houses with the Representative of the Crown marks the beginning of the 4th Session of the 28th Parliament of Canada.
Before proceeding to the business of the new Session I should like to thank you in the name of our Queen and on behalf of all Canadians for your efforts and accomplishments during the long 3rd Session which began the 8th of October 1970 and was concluded only yesterday.
During that period there was a continuing celebration of centennials connected with the foundation of the Canadian Confederation. Manitoba and the Northwest Territories concluded ceremonies which marked the 100th anniversary of their incorporation into the Dominion. The admission of British Columbia, which gave Canada its place on the Pacific Ocean, was commemorated in 1971 with much enthusiasm and a multitude of ceremonies and projects. As in the year before, our gracious Queen and other members of the Royal Family marked the event with an extensive tour, much to the delight of British Columbians and Canadians generally.
It gave my wife and me much satisfaction to take official part on several occasions in the British Columbia celebrations, as well as to travel abroad on behalf of Canada to The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Iran, in response to invitations from the heads of these States so well disposed towards Canada.
Since last I addressed you some 16 months ago, events in Canada and elsewhere have continued to demonstrate the turbulence of this age of changing values and shifting attitudes. We have witnessed with sadness outbursts of violence beyond our shores as despairing men and women have chosen to settle their differences through the use of force, extending in some cases to actual war. We have witnessed as well a period of international economic uncertainty which affected all of the industrialized nations of the world and which has made us increasingly aware of our dependence on a strong economic base in the pursuit of our social goals.
We learned in months gone by that Canada was not immune from internal pressures. In October, 1970 one of the most difficult national challenges in many years was met calmly, with discipline, and with the strong support of the people of Canada. There were sad moments but there were also memorable examples of resoluteness and courage.
More recently, we learned from another type of challenge, this time of an economic nature and coming from without rather than within, that Canada and Canadians possessed the stamina and the resilience to overcome this form of adversity as well.
Throughout, pressures for change around the world emphasized to us that the excitement and the promise of modern technological achievements become hollow and mocking to those who find in society little understanding of their hopes and little provision for their needs. In a period dominated by bigness, in an increasingly impersonal social system, one of the major challenges facing government is to remove the impression of isolation which so often surrounds men and women, depriving them of their sense of worth, of accomplishment, of fulfilment, and removing from them their identity as individuals.
Isolation takes many forms in Canada-physical distance, social stigma, economic deprival. In each of those forms it represents a degree of rejection, of exclusion, of estrangement. This country fails in its essential purpose if it does not ensure that its most precious resource, human talent, is not wasted away. Our challenge is to remove the barriers that create isolation, to permit each Canadian to detect-even if not always able to fulfil-his own potential, to ensure that his image of Canada is one of promise and compassion.
Every one of us is enriched through involvement in this stimulating process we call Canada. Our goals and hopes are bound up in the restlessness and vitality of this rich land. We in this place have a special responsibility to help bring these goals and those hopes within reach, to make real the Canada of which our forefathers dreamed: a land so large that some of it will remain always serene and unspoiled; a society which believes in the dignity of every single individual; a community which husbands its resources and shares them justly among this generation and those to follow; an enterprise which permits and provokes each Canadian to contribute his skills and his talents.
There will be opportunity in this session of this parliament to pursue these ends. The Government will lay before you proposals to continue the development of our national wealth, to deal more compassionately with those in our midst who require help, to involve more Canadians in the ferment and satisfaction of community activities, to protect our natural heritage, and to strengthen our sense of identity and our image of ourselves.
Economic security is one of the most effective forces with which to counter social isolation. Job opportunities must be found and income uncertainties overcome if all Canadians are to share in the richness of this land. To permit the protection and enhancement of those values and those rights which distinguish Canada as a human place, a sound economy is absolutely essential. The attainment of such an economy retains a high priority in the Government's continuing programme. The social phenomenon of economic instability is present today in every industrialized country. We are fortunate that its ill effects have been less pronounced in Canada than elsewhere. Our success in increasing our real gross national product, in the creation of new jobs, and in the maintenance of price stability has been achieved through a policy which encourages an economic environment within which business and all elements of society are able to benefit. At the same time the Government has worked to strengthen and promote the economies of the less developed regions of Canada. Simultaneously, a range of programmes has been introduced to deal with the specific problems of those localities and individuals affected by unemployment at different times of the year.
Unemployment continues to be a matter of intense concern to the Government and will remain a primary focus of attention and action. Co-operation with the business and industrial communities will be extended even further to ensure a favourable business climate. As the economy continues to gain momentum, the private sector will be able increasingly to provide jobs for those Canadians in need of them. The Government will nevertheless redouble its efforts to make sure that as many jobs as possible are available and that the fullest possible use is made of the skills and initiatives of those who are seeking work. It will at the same time continue to exert its influence to prevent the erosion of incomes through the maintenance of reasonably stable prices of the goods and services required by Canadians.
Our economy is dependent, as are the economies of all industrialized countries, on the imagination of entrepreneurs and their use of research and innovation, as well as upon a rational industrial strategy. You will be informed in months to come of government proposals for improved policies in these areas which will be of immense importance to the long term development of our country: of policies for the use of science and technology designed to contribute not only to industry but to the qualitative improvement of the life of Canadians, of an industrial strategy prepared for the peculiar character of the Canadian economy. The basis of each will be spelled out as the session proceeds.
For more than a decade an issue which has attracted increasing interest and growing debate in this country has been that of the control of our economic environment. The debate has emphasized the dual aspects of Canada's identity and of economic benefit for Canadians. Further steps will be taken towards the resolution of this issue.
These policy proposals have been designed with a blend of realism and imagination, as Canada itself was designed more than a century ago. They are intended to permit this country to attain a degree of leadership and independence in selected fields of endeavour while reducing overall Canadian vulnerability to events both expected and unexpected from beyond our shores.
A further imperative in the structuring of strong, internationally competitive industry is the development of a modern and workable competition policy. The development of such a policy, designed to achieve an efficient and innovative economy, capable of rapid growth and dynamic change, must proceed through consultation with all sectors of Canadian society. During the coming weeks the Government will continue this consultative process and will place before Parliament a revised policy reflecting the informed and constructive comments received and assistance gained.
A major factor in the strength of the Canadian economy is provided by exports. The Government will pursue vigorously the initiatives it has taken throughout the world to develop and maintain Canadian markets. Those advantages already gained by ministerial missions to other countries will be enlarged in a number of ways. One of these will involve the provision of better credit facilities. The private financial sector will be encouraged to involve itself increasingly in export financing. The Government will continue to develop programmes to strengthen secondary industry. Closer scientific and technological co-operation with other countries can be expected. Trade negotiations will seek to enlarge opportunities for Canadian manufacturers and the consultative machinery with the European Economic Community and its member states will be strengthened. Negotiations will continue with the United States so as to extend the benefits gained by each member of the world's most important trading partnership.
Policies designed to promote a related, yet distinct, sector of the economy-tourism, will be revealed in coming weeks.
A basic building block in the growth of Canada's national wealth has been the performance of our resource and energy industries. Over the years they have opened new frontiers and stimulated the development of the sinews and muscles of Canada; they have accumulated capital for reinvestment, enhanced the scientific and technical skills of Canadians, and accounted for a healthy export surplus. A continuation and strengthening of government-industry relations is necessary in order that such areas of challenge as environmental impact and the increasing demand both within Canada and abroad for resources and energy be fully addressed.
The competitive requirements for northern development will continue to be recognized; development will not be permitted at the expense of the northern peoples and the northern environment. To ensure the involvement of the residents of the north, and their participation in the design of their own future, there will be continued support for the development of local government in the northern territories.
Canada's primary food producers-our farmers and our fishermen-form one of the traditional and still basic strengths of our economy. Their continued productivity and livelihood is of immense importance to the Government and to the country. Improvements and achievements of the past several months will be strengthened and continued. Measures already undertaken and which have substantially improved prices to fishermen-upwards of 50 percent in some cases-will be extended, ensuring that the benefits of price support for fish products go to the fishermen themselves. Wheat farmers will be assured of an increased return equivalent to the higher price for wheat consumed as food by Canadians. To avoid distortions in food prices, the cost of this programme will be borne by the Treasury rather than by the consumer; to avoid distortions in production, a formula for distribution will be proposed which relates payments to grain acreage rather than to actual wheat production. The Government will assist further the position of farmers and fishermen through the implementation of several programmes. It proposes the establishment of new national marketing agencies and the implementation of a small farm development programme. The recent extensions of fisheries closing lines will permit the Government to engage more actively in the management of its marine resources so as to increase the supply of fish available to Canadian fishermen in the waters off our coasts.
Both the effectiveness and the quality of any programme for the provision of services to Canadians depends increasingly upon a harmonious fiscal relationship between the Federal government and the governments of the ten provinces. Legislation will be introduced, therefore, proposing the renewal and improvement of equalization arrangements, increasing to 100 percent the level of stabilization of provincial revenues, and a number of other items. These will include the administration on behalf of requesting provinces of succession duties and gift taxes, the extension for two years of the transfers to provinces respecting post-secondary education, the provision of a five-year revenue guarantee to provinces to protect their income tax revenues under the new system, and the sharing with provinces of the special tax on undistributed corporate income.
As a further protection against the isolation of individuals caused by economic deprivation, the fundamental reform of protective measures which commenced last year with the new Unemployment Insurance Act will continue. A new Canada Labour Code, reflecting the many representations received in past months, will be introduced as will important amendments to the Fair Employment Practices Act. The Canada Manpower programmes will be improved and additional steps will be taken to make the training and placement services adequate to the needs of specially disadvantaged people whose particular problems present challenges which cannot be met with the use of regular programme resources or techniques. For those persons seeking to further their education, the loan limits under the Canada Student Loans Act will be raised, permitting students to borrow more within a given year and increasing significantly the total amount available under the programme.
The isolation which a product of social injustice is less well understood than that which comes from economic denial. Nevertheless, its consequences dare not be ignored by any society. The irony of isolation in an urban surrounding cannot be resolved by any single act. One essential, however, is the provision of adequate housing of high standard to all Canadians. More dwelling units were started in 1971 than in any single year in our history, including a record number for lower income families. It is clear, however, that Canada's housing needs cannot be met only through increases in scale. What is required, and what the Government will be proposing, are fresh concepts, continuing research, and imagination in neighbourhood improvement with emphasis on the need for low cost housing.
In order to achieve our goal of full participation by all members of society, all barriers leading to isolation must be removed. We cannot invite respect for our laws and support for our institutions from persons to whom they are irrelevant or ineffective. Government activities must reflect the needs of all Canadians, not only the favoured. A giant step in this direction was taken with the adoption last session of tax reform legislation which spreads more evenly the burden of social services on those Canadians best able to bear it. Another step, and long overdue, consists of policies to ensure the equality of women in Canadian society. These will be announced this session.
Protective steps will be proposed in a number of areas of wide concern to Canadians-the non-medical use of drugs, compensation for victims of crime, and the protection of privacy. Progress toward more humane treatment of offenders will continue with further reforms in the penal and parole systems. Amendments will be proposed for reforms in the administration of the criminal law. The Government is committed as well to federal participation in legal aid subject to satisfactory cost-sharing and administrative details being worked out.
It is the view of the Government that the most important single factor in the attainment of individual dignity and active social involvement is the assurance of a secure income. Considerable progress towards the goal of a total income security programme for all Canadians is achieved in the new Family Income Security Plan bill which will be presented for your consideration. The emphasis in this plan is on protection and is consistent with the Government's belief in the strong sense of self-reliance of Canadians.
The pride with which Canadians regard this country and which inspires them to identify with it springs from many sources. Some of these are physical in nature, some cultural, still others are economic. Canadians find in the vast spaces of this land, in its rugged coasts, in its throbbing vitality and in its serene tranquility something of themselves. It is the intention of the Government that immense areas of Canada be preserved in their natural state for the enjoyment of this generation and of generations to come. For the first time some of the grandeur and the wilderness which is Canada's north will be guaranteed perpetual preservation through incorporation into the National Parks System. You will be asked to approve legislation which will create three new parks north of the 60th parallel, each as large and as spectacular as any in the world. These three parks, plus the seven new parks created since 1968, mean that for the first time in our history every province and territory will include within it a national park for the benefit of our people.
Companion legislation will be introduced to provide wildlife habitats and to protect certain endangered wildlife species.
While taking care to preserve for the future, we should, wherever possible, preserve and restore those achievements of the past which are an essential element in our self-understanding as a people. You will be asked to consider, therefore, a bill creating and endowing a corporation to be known as Heritage Canada which will go far to ensure the preservation of items and collections from Canada's past and to make these accessible for the enjoyment and understanding of Canadians in all parts of the country. Heritage Canada, complemented by a broadened National Museums policy, will demonstrate the achievements of our fore-fathers and their successes in overcoming physical isolation and in converting dreams into reality.
Still another form of isolation springs from indifferent communications services. It is a matter of concern to the Government that at this moment many communities do not receive the natior al broadcasting service and that some one million Canadians in 260 communities receive no television service in their own language. The Government proposes, therefore, that the C.B.C. be authorized to extend its services in a comprehensive fashion and to utilize the capabilities of Canada's pioneer satellite communications system to assure within a five year period that at least 98 percent of Canadians are served.
The standards against which a society is judged by others and by history are often those chosen by the society itself. The image it projects, the values to which it adheres, the treatment it accords the disadvantaged in its midst; these are matters for each society to determine, and in determining to be judged. In our relations with one another, in federal-provincial relations, in Canada's relations with other countries, our values are both guides and distinguishing features. Canada is committed to the betterment of life for all, to the resolution of differences by reason not force, to the practice of tolerance, to the acceptance of love and understanding as the most important of human traits. The Government, therefore, will continue to participate fully in international efforts for peace and for the well-being of people everywhere. It will continue to do what it can on behalf of the Canadian people to assist those who are afflicted by calamities, both natural and man-made.
The fluidity in world affairs marked by events in the past months and those expected in the near future present to us an opportunity to deepen and enrich our relationships with our old friends and to seek and strengthen friendships with others both within and without the councils and agencies of the United Nations. Isolation within the international community is as barren and damaging as is isolation within a domestic society. The visits to Canada in 1971 of such distinguished Heads of State and Government as the Presidents of Yugoslavia, Nauru and Niger, and the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, Ceylon, Ghana, Malaysia, Fiji, Senegal, and Israel illustrate the universality of Canada's attitude to the world.
Canada's lines of communication and understanding continue to stand open in all directions. In particular, our ties with our friends in the new Europe and our attachment to the United States remain of the greatest importance. A United States which is strong, dynamic and outward looking is vital to the success of Canada's international endeavours and to our ability to contribute to the well-being of fellow Commonwealth countries and of those states in receipt of Canadian economic assistance including the fellow members of 1'Agence de Cooperation culturelle et technique des pays francophones to whose important conference we acted with pride as host last autumn. The Government and all Canadians anticipate with considerable pleasure the visit to Canada this spring of the President of the United States and Mrs. Nixon.
Our age is marked by inconsistency. Within our societies, the trend all too often is toward increases in size and of impersonality in human relationships while on the planet itself the speed of communication has created a new intimacy among nations. In these circumstances, there is both challenge and opportunity for governments and for individuals. Canada is seized of the challenge. The Government pledges itself to turn the opportunities to the benefit of individual Canadians.
Members of the House of Commons:
During this Session, you will be asked to grant the necessary funds for the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament. Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
The Prime Minister will lay before you today a list of bills that will be submitted to you during the Session.
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
22,29,1,1973-01-05,liberal,"honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I have the honour to welcome you to the First Session of the 29th Parliament of Canada, with a special word of greeting to those who are entering for the first time upon their important duties as legislators.
The New Year promises much of special interest to all of you, in common with other Canadians. Her Majesty The Queen and His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh will visit Canada twice. In late June and early July they will take part in celebrations marking the Centenary of the entry of Prince Edward Island into the Canadian Confederation, the Tercentenary of the City of Kingston, founded in 1673 by Le Comte de Frontenac, and the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. I speak for Canadians generally when I say how pleased we shall all be to have Her Majesty and His Royal Highness with us for these national celebrations.
In August Canadians will again welcome Her Majesty, not only as their Queen but in her role as Head of the Commonwealth. She and the Duke of Edinburgh will be present in Ottawa for the Meeting of the Heads of Government of the Commonwealth. The Government, which will be host for the first time for these periodic meetings, attaches much importance to the Commonwealth and its common traditions, institutions and language. In this connection I note that not two years have passed since Canada was host to a Conference of l'Agence de Cooperation culturelle et technique which brought together representatives of many countries of French expression. These two successive events illustrate the richness of Canada's linguistic duality and the special world associations that we derive from it.
Multilateral Preparatory Talks for the long-awaited Conference on European Security and Co-operation are now under way. Canada has urged that the main conference, to which Canada will be a party, give due weight to the questions of freedom of movement of people, of trade, of information and of technology between East and West.
Separate from the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, but closely connected with it, the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union is now under way, and talks on Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions between the nations of the North Atlantic Alliance and the Warsaw Pact are projected.
As one of the world's great trading nations Canada is sensitive to every development in world trading patterns and world monetary arrangements. The Government is participating actively in the Committee of Twenty established for the reform of the International Monetary System. For three years now the Government has been pressing upon the nations of the enlarged European Common Market the need to be outward-looking and is actively engaged in consultations aimed at strengthening trade and other relationships between Canada and the Common Market. This was a principal subject of discussion when the Prime Minister visited the Prime Minister of Britain last month. The Government has
just announced the appointment of an ambassador solely accredited to the European Economic Communities.
As we set about strengthening our long-established economic, cultural and political ties with Europe we do not lose sight of our closest ally and our primary market beyond our borders, the United States. The Government will continue its discussions with the United States to settle certain difficulties that have arisen in our trading arrangements with that country, and to maintain and expand our trading opportunities there.
Access to foreign markets for exporters will receive particular emphasis. A new round of multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is planned for the fall of 1973. The Government will participate vigorously in these negotiations.
At home, the Government remains fully committed to two preeminent goals, national unity and equality of opportunity for all Canadians.
In pursuit of these goals, the Government assigns the highest priority to two policy areas:
-economic policy, to reduce unemployment, contain inflation and strengthen the economy generally -social policy, to bring about, in consultation with the Provinces, a re-organization of existing social security programs.
In the area of economic policy, the Government has four main objectives:
First, to expand job opportunities at a rate that will bring about as rapid as possible a decline in the numbers of unemployed Second, to promote stable economic growth at a rate that will sustain rising standards of living for all our citizens and provide for more satisfactory realization of the potential of the economy Third, to attain reasonable price stability
Fourth, to ensure that all regions of the country benefit from the prosperity brought about by the expanding economy.
To attain its economic objectives, the Government has set in motion a two-part program.
The first part consists of measures to provide more jobs immediately by strengthening and broadening existing programs. These measures have been announced and are already taking effect:
-increased funding for the Local Initiatives Program -increased funding for on the job training
__a substantial seasonal capital works project to be undertaken in
co-operation with the Provinces and municipalities
__special funding to increase direct employment by the Federal
Government in labour-intensive projects.
The second part consists of measures that will add to the fundamental strength of the economy, can be acted upon this session and can be expected to have effect with a minimum of delay:
-amendments to the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act and the Customs Tariff, reintroducing measures announced earlier -major revision of the General Adjustment Assistance Plan, to enable industry to take advantage of opportunities for increasing our foreign trade
-aid to small businesses through new initiatives to strengthen management and consulting services and to improve access to financing facilities
-extension and improvement of the Industrial Development Bank -measures to assist in the development of the tourist industry in Canada
-amendments to the Export Development Act, increasing the capital of the Export Development Corporation and raising the financial ceilings for lending, guarantees, export insurance and foreign insurance operations -assistance to cooperatives and credit unions -renewed measures to reduce deeply-entrenched regional economic disparities. The Department of Regional Economic Expansion will be decentralized to a greater degree to be in a better position to identify opportunities for economic development
-review of research and development incentive programs to improve their effectiveness in promoting innovation in the private sector of the economy, including examination of patenting, licensing and other policies related to technology -measures to ensure further control by Canadians over their economy by the screening of foreign takeovers of Canadian-owned business; measures respecting the transfer of technology from abroad and access to it by Canadian entrepreneurs; measures to increase Canadian participation in the ownership and control of resource projects; and, in consultation with the Provinces, measures dealing with new direct foreign investment and the sale of land to foreigners
-measures that will restructure the Canada Corporations Act, including a requirement that a majority of directors of federally incorporated companies be Canadians -the Government will meet with the provincial governments in the five regions of the country, to examine the impact of freight rates on economic development and consumer prices. The railways have agreed to participate in these meetings.
Taken together these measures will contribute to the development and elaboration of a coherent set of industrial policies for Canada.
In the area of social policy, the Government considers that Canada's total social security system-including both federal and provincial elements-must be reconsidered and reorganized, and made more sensitive to the needs of people in different parts of the country.
The Government intends that this reorganization should be based on five principles which, taken together, comprise a statement of the Government's commitment in respect of social security.
First, the social security system must assure to people who cannot work, the aged, the blind and the disabled, a compassionate and equitable guaranteed annual income.
Second, the social security system as it applies to people who can work must contain incentives to work and a greater emphasis on the need to get people who are on social aid back to work.
Third, a fair and just relationship must be maintained between the incomes of people who are working at or near the minimum wage, the guaranteed incomes assured to people who cannot work, and the allowances paid to those who can work but are unemployed.
Fourth, it must be recognized that Provinces may wish to have the structures of social security vary in accordance with the social needs, income standards and the cost of living in different communities.
Finally, it must be accepted that the reconsideration of Canada's social security system must be conducted jointly by the Federal Government and the Provinces. A better social security system can only be realized if a reasonable consensus can be reached between the Governments of Canada and the Provinces. To this end, the Government will invite provincial representatives to a conference of welfare ministers in April.
Certain immediate steps will be taken by the Government, consistent with the principles proposed above. In respect of people who can work but are temporarily unemployed, legislation will be introduced to clarify certain aspects of the Unemployment Insurance Plan and to prevent abuses that have not been overcome by the administrative action already taken.
A fair and equitable regime of family allowances is fundamental to an efficient social security system. A new family income security program will be proposed that will particularly take into account the needs of the lower income families. Legislation will be introduced to improve the economic situation of old age pensioners.
Subject to the appropriate agreement being reached with the Provinces, changes to improve the Canada Pension Plan will be introduced to provide higher pensions for widows, widows with dependent children and the disabled and to make other needed amendments.
In another area of social policy, the field of housing and urban development, the Government proposes the following action, in co-operation with the Provinces:
-assistance in the provision of low-cost housing and other accommodation for senior citizens
-home-ownership assistance to low and moderate income families
-new incentives for housing provided by co-operatives and nonprofit corporations
-assistance in the rehabilitation of older neighbourhoods -a land assembly program to assist in the creation of new communities and to check urban sprawl -encouragement to investors to make more money available to meet housing needs
-a warranty system to protect the purchasers of new houses -assistance in the relocation of railway tracks and other facilities -study of the Government's responsibilities with regard to urban transportation generally.
In response to the increasing importance of fitness for the wellbeing and health of Canadians and the need for greater opportunities for people to participate in sports activities, it is proposed over the next three fiscal years to more than double the current level of expenditures under the Fitness and Amateur Sport Program. Plans for a greatly expanded and a strengthened program will be announced.
Inflation is a world-wide problem. The Government is determined to contain inflation in Canada to protect the purchasing power of the Canadian dollar in the hands of the Canadian people and to protect Canada's position in world trade. While food prices in Canada have steadied slightly in the last month or so, the Government is concerned about possible future effects of the world-wide trend toward higher food prices and will propose the setting up of a Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons to make a special study of this problem.
Efficient communications between all parts of the country are essential to the unity and prosperity of Canada. Technological developments can have a pervasive effect on the social and economic well-being of all Canadians. The Government will, in the near future, submit to Parliament proposals for a national communications policy, and for resolving problems arising from the growing interaction between broadcasting and other forms of telecommunication, giving due weight to the interests and concerns of the Provinces.
The Government will introduce legislation establishing a competition policy to preserve and strengthen the market system upon which our economy is based. The new policy will be in harmony with industrial policies in general and foreign investment policy in particular.
World-wide demand for our agricultural products is strong, in particular for our wheat and other grains. The Government will concentrate its attention upon transportation, storage and handling problems to ensure efficient and timely movement and delivery of grain and other agricultural products.
You will be asked to amend the Crop Insurance Act to allow the Government to reimburse the Provinces to a maximum of fifty percent of premiums paid under contracts of insurance, thereby reducing costs of insurance to individual farmers.
The Government supports the principle of an equitable relationship of prices of feed grain to livestock feeders in various areas of Canada. It is the intention of the Government to implement before the next crop year, procedures that will ensure the optimum development of the feed grain and livestock industries within Canada.
Measures to protect the natural environment and to enhance the productivity of Canada's renewable resource industries will be laid before you. In addition to amendments to the Fisheries Development Act, 'you will be asked to consider an Environmental Contaminants Act and a Canada Wildlife Act.
To preserve the ecological integrity of Canada's coastal and maritime areas, further preparations will be made for the Third United Nations Law of the Sea Conference.-The Ministry of State for Science and Technology, in co-operation with the Department of the Environment and other interested departments, will recommend a national program of research and development in the field of Marine Science and Technology.
The Government will continue its efforts through national, bilateral and multilateral measures to overcome the continuing menace posed by aerial hijacking. In particular, you will be asked to amend the Aeronautics Act to provide for strict security measures to be taken at airports, including the search of persons and property.
You will be asked to consider legislation amending the Immigration Act, to curb abuses including the exploitation of the provisions allowing visitors to apply for immigrant status while in Canada. You will also be asked to amend the Immigration Appeal Board Act to provide for the rapid and equitable disposition of outstanding immigration appeals and prevent the recurrence of large-scale appeal backlogs.
The growing complexity of our society calls for increasing coordination of federal and provincial government programs. The Prime Minister will propose a meeting in the spring with the provincial First Ministers to plan further steps in the harmonization of goals, policies and programs for the benefit of all Canadians, particularly in fields that bear on the responsibilities of both levels of government.
Federal-provincial meetings at the ministerial level are also projected on a range of urgent matters, including:
-financial and economic policy -the Report of the Economic Council of Canada -health care programs -post-secondary education -housing
-restrictions upon foreign ownership of land -income security -industrial policy.
The Government will propose to the Governments of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba that they join with it in the convening of a conference on western economic opportunities. Such a conference would be a unique venture in the history of federal-provincial relations in Canada. It could be jointly planned, and held in the West in the course of the summer. Its purpose would be to explore potentials for economic and social development and, specifically, to consider concrete programs for stimulating and broadening the economic and industrial base of western Canada.
Among such concrete programs, the Government would propose for discussion the possible establishment of new regionally-based financial institutions better able to serve the financing needs of business enterprise and industrial development in western Canada.
A second suggestion for joint study would be improvement in the total transportation system, so basic to overcoming the problems of distance: in the region, from other parts of Canada and from ocean ports. The development needs of the northern frontier areas in all four Provinces could also be explored.
The Government recognizes that western Canadians wish to build industrial strength on top of their region's great resource and energy base. As the whole economy continues to grow a greater measure of decentralization of industrial activity will be necessary to achieve this desired regional objective.
The Government believes these and other issues would rank high on an agenda for western development. It would seek as well views and suggestions with regard to the continuing mechanisms for federal-provincial consultations on policies for western expansion, within an over-all framework of national growth.
The Government intends to widen the area of service to Canada open to personnel in the Canadian Armed Forces. In addition to maintaining a high degree of military capability as the primary and most essential role of the Forces, new emphasis will be placed on the many areas in which the varied skills and training of this large number of dedicated Canadians can contribute to the achievement of national goals.
You will be asked to amend the Public Service Staff Relations Act and the Public Service Employment Act.
Parliament will be asked to confirm the basic principles of the Government's program for bilingualism in the Public Service.
The Government will continue to work in furtherance of the objectives of the Official Languages Act. Further assistance will be offered to the Provinces to help ensure that to the extent possible:
-Canadians can educate their children in the official language of their choice
-Canadian students can learn, as a second language, the other official language
-Provincial governments can develop an increased capacity to serve their citizens in both official languages, as may be required.
The Government will continue to encourage through its multicultural policy the development of a society in which individuals and groups can develop and express their own cultural identity. An Advisory Council to the Minister of State responsible for multiculturalism will be established.
Measures will be introduced directed at reform of the penal and parole systems to improve prisoner rehabilitation and the protection of the public.
The five-year trial period in which imposition of the death penalty has been limited to cases involving the killing of policemen and prison guards has come to an end. You will be asked to decide, by a free vote and as a matter of urgency, upon the future of the death penalty in the Canadian law enforcement system.
Proposals dealing with conflicts of interest as they may affect Members of Parliament, Ministers of the Crown and Public Servants will be laid before you.
You will be asked to consider an Election Expenses Bill.
The Government will recommend to the House of Commons the broadcasting, by radio and television, of all or a part of its proceedings and the proceedings of its Committees.
You will be asked to consider other legislative proposals. Members of the House of Commons,
The Government intends to present a budget early in the session. It is timely to provide to Parliament a full report on Canada's financial and economic situation, and to propose fiscal and other measures for the effective management of the economy.
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations. [Translation]"
23,29,2,1974-02-27,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
I have the honour to welcome you to the Second Session of the 29th Parliament of Canada.
In addressing you for the first time, I should like to express my feeling of honour at having been chosen Her Majesty's representative in Canada. As I said at the time of my investiture, the office which I have the honour to hold has a continuous history of three and a half centuries. I am anticipating with pleasure the opportunity to travel in Canada and to meet citizens from all walks of life.
We look forward to the visit of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother, for whom all Canadians have a great affection. She will be in Canada from June 25th to June 30th to present new colours to the Toronto Scottish and to the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada; Her Majesty is Colonel-in-Chief of both regiments.
I speak to you at a time of serious disturbance in the international economic situation, arising from problems of supply and price of certain commodities, particularly oil.
Most countries, developed and developing, witnessed significant economic expansion in 1973. The economic prospects for 1974 seemed, until recently, no less encouraging. The reduction of the amount of oil exported by some of the major producing countries and the increase in price has brought a sudden and dramatic change in this situation.
For the developing countries of the world, the increased cost of oil has in many cases wiped out the small margins on which they depended for economic development and better means to support their growing populations. For the industrialized countries, of which Canada is one of the few close to being self-reliant in oil and energy generally, it means that many of them will incur large balance of payments deficits and will have to find means of financing them. For the world as a whole, it could mean an over-all reduction in demand with a consequent depressing effect on economic activity.
The Government attaches the highest importance to solving these problems through concerted international action and co-ordination of national policies. The meeting of the major oil importing countries was a first step in this direction. It will be followed by meetings with the oil producing states and the developing countries. The United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international organizations will also become actively involved.
In working toward a solution of these international economic problems the major consuming countries must recognize the legitimate aspirations of all the producing countries to utilize their resources to assist in their own national economic development. But the developed world, as well as the resource-rich countries of the developing world, must also take increasingly vigorous steps to reduce disparities between themselves and the less developed and less fortunate nations.
While the developments affecting the supply and price of oil are in part the product of special circumstances, the underlying situation thus set in relief is much more general. Food prices have risen sharply as a result of the growth of world population on which has been superimposed serious crop failures in a number of countries. The prices of other internationally-traded commodities have also increased following the simultaneous upsurge in economic activity in all industrialized countries. The increases in the food and commodity sectors have moreover, led to increases in other prices producing generalized inflationary pressures.
No country has been immune from the increase in prices experienced in 1973 and which is continuing in 1974. The phenomenon is worldwide, not an isolated one affecting this or that country alone.
All countries, including Canada, have rejected a deliberately planned slowdown in economic activity as a means to fight inflation. Some have turned to income and price controls. These attempts have on the whole not been successful.
The Canadian economy, perhaps more than any other, is closely tied to international trade and markets. The principal inflationary pressures have come from outside the country. It would have been singularly inappropriate under such conditions to have resorted to general income and price controls and the Government rejected them for these reasons.
A principal responsibility of the Government and one of its main policy objectives is to maintain high levels of income, production and employment. This policy should in itself help to overcome some of the supply problems which are causing prices to rise. But in addition, and more immediately, the Government's policy in dealing with inflation will be to step in, as it has done in the past, and take specific measures to increase the supply of certain goods and services, to protect those who are not able to protect themselves against the effects of inflation, to cushion consumers against sudden and disruptive price increases of essential commodities, and to prevent any group or groups from taking undue advantage of the current situation at the expense of others.
In the case of oil, the Government has been concerned about the individual hardships caused by the rise in prices and about the over-all effect of the increase on the economy. Nonetheless, for Canada to become self-reliant and be protected against abrupt changes in supply, prices must be such as to encourage the exploration and development of non-conventional and frontier oil resources. The Government must ensure that a sufficient part of the funds generated by higher prices will be used for such exploration and development. It will introduce legislation to create a national petroleum company which will assure greater Canadian presence and participation in these and other activities. It has announced the extension of the pipeline from the western oil fields to Eastern Canada and the establishment of a single Canadian market which will guarantee an outlet for domestically-produced oil.
In furthering these longer-term objectives, the Government has a duty to manage the economy in the interests of all Canadians, and in particular to moderate the inflationary effects resulting from the oil crisis. It has sought, in co-operation with the provinces, to make sure that the difficult transition to higher oil and energy costs occurs in an orderly way so as to not cause unnecessary disruptions in economic activity, employment and prices. To this end, it must ensure that the price of domestically-produced oil does not increase at an unreasonable rate and that the price of oil be the same in all parts of Canada subject, of course, to transportation costs. Legislation will be introduced to ensure that the responsibilities of the Government in these respects can be effectively discharged.
Discussion with the provinces on the Government's objectives and on the best means of achieving them is continuing. The Government will make every effort to reach agreement on arrangements that will discharge its responsibilities in a way that is fair to the provinces where the main sources of the oil and gas are located as well as to consumers in the country as a whole.
At the same time as there is increasing concern about shortages in the supply of energy, it is apparent there is an inadequate supply of food in many parts of the world. In some countries the situation has reached critical proportions. In Canada there have not been such serious shortages but international market pressures have forced our food prices upwards. It is clear that this country's production must be increased. The Government is developing a policy on food based on the following objectives:
-an adequate and dependable supply of quality food for a growing population in Canada enjoying a rising standard of living;
-reasonable food prices:
-for the consumer, in not requiring an undue proportion of income for Canadians to secure a sufficient and balanced diet,
-for the producer, in providing a return adequate to encourage production of food items which can be economically and efficiently produced in Canada;
-a continuing supply and increasing production of those food products in which Canada has a competitive advantage for export to 
commercial markets and also for a contribution to international food aid programs.
The Government's objectives will guide a re-assessment of existing programs in the areas of agriculture and fisheries. The Government will wish to consult with provincial governments, consumer groups and producers.
The producer must be ensured a fair income for his work. His confidence in long-term market opportunities is an essential element in the Government's policy. The producer should have access to all markets in Canada. He will also be encouraged to expand food exports.
The consumer must be ensured a fair value from his dollar. He must be protected against disruptive increases in the price of essential foodstuffs caused by international market demand. Guarantees against unduly low prices to producers must be coupled with guarantees against unduly high prices to consumers.
In the long term the continuity of domestic supply must take into account optimum over-all land use in Canada and especially the trend to diversion of productive land for non-agricultural purposes. The Government intends to enter into discussions with the provinces since they are vitally involved in this question.
As positive steps in the achievement of adequate supplies of food at a reasonable cost, measures directed in the main at increasing food production will be laid before you in the following areas:
-guaranteed loans and other forms of assistance to both farmers and fishermen to assist them in purchasing or modernizing their equipment;
-amendments to the Export and Import Permits Act to provide the Government with better means to stabilize the Canadian market;
-improving the availability of manpower for food production;
-assistance in the construction of new storage facilities;
-research to make it possible to increase production, improve quality, and lower costs;
-improvements in harbour facilities for fishing fleets;
-incentives to increase Canada's catch of unexploited stocks of fish; -advance payments on crops to assure producers of timely cash receipts;
-an agricultural stabilization plan to encourage rational production decisions;
-assistance to young farmers to provide sufficient financial incentives for them to establish themselves in farming;
-better veterinary training facilities;
-a prairie grain market insurance plan;
-improvements in Canadian grain rail transportation capabilities;
-increased availability of reasonably priced feed grains;
-incentives to increase the production of livestock necessary to provide for Canadian and export markets.
As part of the Government's economic management, a major element in the policy to mitigate inflation is to increase production and supply: many measures have been indicated with respect to energy and food. Of course, Canadians must strengthen their economy in other ways to expand employment opportunities and achieve a greater degree of control over their economic affairs.
Measures will be proposed to aid small businesses, both financially and by providing better counselling services by the creation of a Federal Business Development Bank. Steps will be taken to ensure further processing of resources in Canada. The Government will encourage the development of the petrochemical industry based on the upgrading of Canadian resources and better access to world markets. Amendments will be proposed to the Bank Act in order to permit provinces to participate in the ownership of banks. An amendment to the Export Development Act will be introduced to encourage further expansion of Canada's foreign trade. Proposals will be made to ensure Canadian control of the computer communications field. Amendments to the Combines Investigation Act, directed at encouraging competition, will be put before you.
The development and use of technology is also essential to the Government's approach to increasing national economic production. Steps will be taken to obtain greater returns from industrial research and development as well as technological innovation in Canada.
Scientific knowledge and its application is a keystone to meeting the challenges facing Canada, including those in the areas of food, energy or industrial development. The objective of the Government's science policy is the rational generation and acquisition of scientific knowledge and the planned use of science and technology in support of national goals. The Ministry of State for Science and Technology will be developing national science objectives as a basis for exercising enhanced advisory and co-ordinating authority within the Government. Two new granting councils will be formed, one for social sciences and humanities and the other for natural sciences.
The Government attaches great importance to regional development. Many of the measures to be introduced during this session were discussed at the Western Economic Opportunities Conference, and will be of benefit to all areas of Canada. Transportation in particular is a key factor in regional development. A number of measures will be taken in the larger context of ensuring that Canada's transportation capability supports the Government's national goals and is safe and efficient. Steps will be taken to end any discrimination in freight rates. A new ports policy will be developed to ensure an effective and comprehensive port structure in Canada in a framework where a high degree of local involvement in management and improvement of ports can be established.
Other measures will be taken to increase production and employment through providing workers with improved access to available jobs, and employers with improved access to Canada's manpower. These steps will relate employment policy, immigration policy and the activities of the Unemployment Insurance Commission. The Government will be working together with the provinces in developing a community employment policy in a social security context for those Canadians who have particular and continuing difficulty in getting and keeping employment. Amendments will be introduced to the Unemployment Insurance Act as a part of a comprehensive review of the plan undertaken in the light of the experience of the last few years.
In the domain of social policy the Government is playing a vital role to achieve a more balanced pattern of urban growth and to increase the quality of life in our cities in co-operation with the provinces and municipalities. Improved means of public transportation are indispensable to the achievement of these urban goals. Measures will be introduced to establish a National Urban Transportation Development Corporation to co-ordinate and market the development of required new technology in this field. You will be asked to consider measures to assist provinces and cities in the relocation of railway lines and terminals and in the redevelopment of these areas for purposes that will enhance the environment of many of our cities and towns.
Provision of adequate shelter at reasonable prices in a satisfactory neighbourhood environment has been a continuing concern of the Government, and levels of funding to meet this objective are being reviewed. Substantial assistance to rural and native housing programs will also be proposed. The sewage assistance program will be revised to make it more effective as a means to increase the supply of serviced land. The Government will introduce measures to increase the protection available to consumers in the housing market.
The Government has taken many measures to improve the status of women in Canada since the Report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women. Amendments to the statutes of Canada will be placed before you for the purpose of providing equal treatment for women. The legislation to be introduced creating a Federal Commission on Human Rights and Interests will include provisions to protect women from discriminatory practices. Regulations governing government employees will be amended to remove all possible inequities based on sex. Crown corporations will be asked to undertake positive action to encourage the assignment and advancement of more women into responsible positions within their administration. The Government's objective is to create a society free from discrimination.
List of Legislation
The federal and provincial governments have agreed that the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans should be further amended to provide for increases, beyond 1975, in the levels of income upon which contributions may be made, and in the pensions which will be paid. Legislation will be introduced to remove the earnings test now required for people aged 65 to 69 from the Canada Pension Plan. Finally, federal and provincial ministers have agreed that the provisions which now accord differential treatment to men and women under the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans should be removed.
You will be asked to consider other legislative proposals.
Members of the House of Commons,
The Government intends to present a budget in this session.
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
24,30,1,1974-10-01,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I have the honour to welcome you to the First Session of the 30th Parliament of Canada.
I am here today in my capacity as Administrator of the Government of Canada, duties which I assumed following the illness suffered by
the Governor General last June. Canadians were saddened to hear of His Excellency's stroke, but have been encouraged by reports of his steady progress. I am happy to say that his recovery is such that providing all continues to go well he will be able to resume his role before too long. I am sure I reflect the feelings of all Canadians in expressing gratitude that he will be able to give further service to his country in the high office which he holds.
This year marks an event of particular interest and importance to all Canadians-the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the entry of Newfoundland into Confederation. We anticipate with great pleasure the visit of His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh, who will shortly join us to share in this happy occasion. In November the citizens of Ontario will welcome Her Royal Highness Princess Anne and her husband who will attend the opening of the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair and other civic engagements.
The international economic situation is serious, with a high rate of inflation, balance of payments problems, lower growth rates and the rapid accumulation of large currency reserves by a few countries. Canada is engaging in bilateral and multilateral discussions as part of a concerted effort to ensure that the current fragile state of the world's economy is strengthened. Those developing countries lacking the natural resources which have enabled others to benefit from high commodity prices have been particularly hard hit by this situation. Canada is contributing to international measures to reduce the unjust and potentially dangerous gap between the rich and the poor. This will involve us not only in increasing the flow of financial assistance to developing countries but in re-examining other policies which affect our economic relations with the Third World.
Canada has contributed to many international peacekeeping operations. A source of special concern at present is the instability in Cyprus and in the Middle East where 2,000 members of Canada's Armed Forces are performing dedicated service with the two peacekeeping forces which the United Nations has established there. While these forces have had some success in keeping the belligerents apart, the necessary policital solutions appear distant and, unhappily, civilian casualties, as well as casualties among members of the peacekeeping forces, continue.
In the context of the United Nations, Canada will also take:
-initiatives to provide for adequate safeguards so that spreading nuclear technology and materials are not perverted for military purposes;
-initiatives to increase world food aid so that the disastrous shortages some countries are experiencing may be alleviated.
For Canada as well as for most of the world the most serious problem is inflation; it is necessary both to deal with its causes and to mitigate its effects. This world-wide problem had its origins in the largest increases in food, energy and other commodity prices in a generation, occurring at the same time as an upsurge in economic activity in all major industrialized nations. The policy of the Government on inflation has been to pursue appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, and:
-to increase the supply of goods and services;
-to protect those least able to protect themselves; as well as -to soften the impact of soaring oil prices on Canadian consumers and to cushion the economy against disruptive increases in other commodities.
It was generally expected, inside Canada and outside, that the tide of inflation would recede as conditions in the international food and commodity markets returned to normal, but a new situation has been created. The major oil exporting countries have re-affirmed their determination to keep the prices of their oil to importing countries, including Canada, at a high level. New adversities have fallen upon crops in Canada, the United States and elsewhere with possible adverse effects for food prices. Industrial commodities have not generally fallen in price as much as some expected in a world of static or falling industrial production. International interest rates have been pushed up to record levels and financial markets have been seriously disturbed.
Industrial unrest has become more prevalent in the world as a result of inflation. Agreements reached through collective bargaining are being abrogated as workers feel they have inadequate compensation to
deal with inflation. In some countries there is a threat to the cohesion of the very fabric of society.
As various groups in society try to protect themselves against rising prices by seeking higher incomes, a stronger element of cost derived inflation is created. It is clear that some groups are much better equipped to protect themselves than others. Corporations, trade and professional associations, labour unions and governments are in most cases all able to adjust to inflation, but there are many Canadians on fixed incomes and others lacking economic power whose incomes are not rising as rapidly as the rate of inflation and for whom the consequences of inflation are a cause for concern.
Canada has thus far suffered less from inflation than most other countries, but the problem is serious and urgent. For its part, the Government will exercise restraint in its own expenditures with particular emphasis on improving effectiveness and efficiency in its existing operations while controlling expansion of new activities which, although desirable, would contribute to inflationary pressures. The Federal Government will urge that provincial and municipal governments take similar steps.
The total expenditures of the Federal Government in the 1975-76 fiscal year are expected to incorporate the costs of certain major new measures, including payments to equalize prices of petroleum products in Canada. Insofar as further new initiatives are concerned, the Government will be conscious of the need for restraint and careful phasing in relation to the state of the economy. Federal expenditures on goods and services, as opposed to various transfer payments, have remained relatively constant as a proportion of Gross National Product for some years, and their proportion was lower in 1973 than it was in 1961.
The Government does not intend deliberately to generate slack in the economy in order to combat inflation. Higher production, not lower, is essential to slowing down price advances. The Government does intend to ask all Canadians to join with it in a co-operative effort to achieve by non-inflationary means an equitable sharing among all groups in the community of the fruits of our productive efforts.
In order to increase the supply of goods and services, which is the first objective of the Government in dealing with inflation, a number of measures will be proposed:
-To increase food production-
-incentives to farmers and fishermen including the stabilization of incomes and markets,
-continued international action to ensure that Canada has the right to manage its coastal resources and environment, including the conservation of fish stocks;
-To increase construction of homes-
-financial assistance in order to reduce the cost of serviced land and to encourage land assembly;
-To increase economic productivity-
-greater financial and other support for small business,
-continued reorientation of manpower activities so that Canadians are trained and available in the right locations to fill the increased number of job opportunities,
-amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act,
-extension of the Regional Development Incentives Act;
-To increase the supply of energy-
-the establishment of Petro-Canada, the national petroleum corporation,
-guarantees for domestic control of uranium and for adequate future supplies related to Canadian needs,
-steps to ensure that the price of Canadian oil and gas is regulated in a manner which will encourage necessary exploration and development in Canada;
-To ensure continued export of Canadian grain-
-legislation to ensure the resumed movement of Western grain, if the current dispute has not already been resolved,
-steps to facilitate grain handling this winter.
In order to help protect those particularly hard hit by inflation, which is another objective in the battle against inflation, the following measures will be taken or proposed:
-To monitor food prices-
-renew the mandate of the Food Prices Review Board until the end of 1975 so that it may continue to report regularly on trends in food prices and analyze the reasons for price changes in specific areas;
-To help home buyers-
-additional assistance to buyers of moderately priced housing who have not owned a home before,
-ask financial institutions to continue to direct all low down payment high ratio mortgages exclusively to moderately priced housing,
-a Registered Home Owners Savings Plan,
-a system of warranties which will protect new buyers of National Housing Act financed homes,
-better disclosure provisions for the true interest rates on mortgages;
-To protect the consumer-
-first stage amendment of the Combines Investigation Act, including measures dealing with unfair or uncompetitive business practices such as misleading advertising and pyramid, referral or bait-and-switch selling,
-a comprehensive overhaul of consumer credit legislation, including disclosure by all lending institutions of effective rates of interest on all loans,
-a total revision of our bankruptcy law, including special procedures to help the consumer debtor,
-improved safety of consumer electrical products,
-establishment of more consumer storefront offices;
-To assist those having difficulty finding employment, and in cooperation with the provinces-
-a community employment strategy for people who experience chronic and particular difficulty in finding and keeping regular employment,
-special efforts on behalf of individuals and specific groups who are ready and willing to work but tend to experience particular difficulty in finding regular employment;
-To help older citizens, the needy and war veterans-
-provide for regular increases in the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings in 1976 and subsequent years, revise the Year's Basic Exemption, and eliminate the earnings test on retirement pensions for people aged 65 to 70,
-provide for the payment of allowances to the spouses aged 60 to 65 of Old Age Security recipients effective October 1975 and eliminate certain hardships involving Canadians absent from Canada for limited periods of time,
-achieve equity as between provinces in the application of the Canada Assistance Plan in respect of the treatment of youthful offenders in other than welfare institutions, and in respect of the care given needy persons in nursing-homes in provinces that have introduced universal nursing-home care programs, and -further increases in war veterans allowances.
The third objective of the Government's policy to combat inflation is to take such specific initiatives in the economy as are required in order to deal with unjustified increases in incomes, prices and profits.
The Government will introduce legislation to deal with unjustified price increases where such increases are identified. This legislation will be designed to ensure that unacceptable profit levels are not being realized.
You will be asked to approve the imposition of an export charge on crude oil and certain other petroleum products to provide compensation for Canadians who consume imported oil and to regulate the price of Canadian hydrocarbons in interprovincial trade, so that all Canadians pay the same basic price, plus appropriate transportation charges, no matter where they may live.
There must be a greater awareness of the need for restraint by everyone in what each seeks to secure in incomes, profits, prices or taxes if inflation is to be mitigated. Demands to secure more than the economy can provide, or indeed for those who already have a respecter. Speaker.]
able return to seek to benefit relatively from inflation, must be resisted, and the Government believes it has a clear responsibility in this area. Just as no one group in society should benefit at the expense of others from inflation, so should no one group shoulder an unfair burden.
The Government has therefore initiated a series of consultations with the principal groups in our society-business, professions, farmers, labour and provincial governments. They will be asked what proposals they can suggest and what contribution they are willing to make to defeat inflation. They will be asked how productivity can be increased. They will be asked if improvements can be made to the basically adversarial nature of the collective bargaining system, leading toward a joint search for solutions to mutual problems. Representatives of the private pension industry will be asked to explore jointly with Government ways of protecting pensioners against inflation. The Government will ensure that these consultations deal with the problems of those lacking organized power in the economy and retired people, for in many cases they are the ones most adversely affected by inflation.
The Federal Government believes that it has the responsibility of playing the leading role in bringing Canadians together to discuss their common problems and challenges and to develop proposals for their solution. The Government intends to fulfill this leadership role with vigour and determination. These meetings will form part of a major effort by the Federal Government to enter into a dialogue with all segments of the Canadian community.
In the inter-related society and economy of today, a clear distribution of responsibilities among the different levels of government in a federal state cannot in practical application have the neat precision that it has in political theory. Few actions can be taken by one level of government without affecting, or taking into account, the policies and programs of another. In many areas of government activity, effective implementation of a government's policy depends upon the cooperation of other levels of government. Consequently the Government will:
-propose a number of conferences with the provinces during the coming year, including one at the First Ministers level early in 1975; and
-take new measures within the federal administrative structure to improve the coordination of federal policies and programs that are of interest to the provinces and to make consultation with them even more effective.
A key factor in increasing supply is transportation. More generally, transportation is vital to Canada providing for the flow of people and goods that link and bind our regions. It is at the heart of our ability to function as a domestic economy, and as a trading nation. Transportation must be an instrument of national purpose, designed to achieve broad social and economic objectives. While the scale of Canada is one of its greatest assets, equally, it poses challenges of distance and communication virtually unique in the world. These problems are particularly real for the provinces and regions away from central industrial Canada. The Government does not believe the principles underlying the present transportation system or its methods of management and operation are adequate to meet current and future national aspirations.
The Government believes transportation rates should continue to be based on the principle of competition among alternative modes of transportation in areas where there is effective competition. Where such competition does not meaningfully exist, transportation rates cannot be allowed to exact what the market will bear. Consideration of costs, as reflected in the provision of comparable services in circumstances where competition is effective, is a more acceptable guide, and it is toward the achievement of equitable arrangements on such a basis that the Government will work. Even as so qualified, the principle of effective competition may have to be subject to exceptions to permit the achievement of national policies relating to the reduction of regional economic disparities and the encouragement of a more balanced distribution of industry.
The Government is conducting a comprehensive examination of the ability of existing ground, air and marine transportation systems to meet present and growing future demands for passenger and goods services. Also under review are the roles of the various bodies which manage, operate and regulate the transportation system. The aim is to determine the role of government in both the public and private sectors of transportation, the most rational use of available capital resources, and the most appropriate means of balancing existing regulation and direct government intervention. While the cooperation of all parties will be sought, these problems are of a scale that they require Federal Government coordination. This work will lead to the implementation over the next several years, at a rate matched to the Government's overall financial ability, of a program of changes designed to produce a modern, safe, efficient and coordinated transportation system.
There are a number of new initiatives that the Government is prepared to undertake immediately designed to improve transportation services in Canada which will not in any way prejudice the review of basic policy to come:
-a program in cooperation with the railways which will lead to the eventual creation of new Government machinery to ensure the effective management of all ground transport;
-immediate implementation of experimental programs designed to upgrade progressively a number of intercity passenger train services;
-ensuring an adequate supply of rail cars for the future and to resolve rail access problems to all major ports and distribution centres;
-improved transportation to and from remote areas, including further assistance to airports in small municipalities, and a new program to fund airports located in developing areas of the country;
-legislation to provide for the most efficient port system for Canada compatible with local, regional and national interests;
-steps leading to the creation of Canadian-owned ice-breaking cargo vessels for use in the North;
-establishment of an Independent Accident Investigation Board;
-new laws concerning shipping and the coasting trade in Canada;
-ensuring rail costing data will be made available to provincial governments pending consideration of a more comprehensive transportation information act;
-additional steps to strengthen the effectiveness of urban transportation systems and improvement of commuter services compatible with regional and provincial plans for urban development.
The Government believes further steps must be taken to enhance Canada's independence and sense of identity. To this end measures will be proposed to:
-revise the law governing corporations including the introduction of a provision whereby a majority of directors of federally incorporated companies must be Canadian;
-provide for Government intervention in cases where a Canadian company may be prevented from fulfilling export orders by its foreign ownership;
-enhance Canadian processing of the country's natural resources which are exported, involving consultations with the provinces and negotiations with other countries;
-ensure Canadian technological innovation is encouraged and available for the benefit of Canadian industry;
-ensure ownership of fishing vessel licenses is retained by Canadians;
-produce a new Citizenship Act;
-confirm O Canada! as our national anthem;
-restructure federally supported granting councils which provide money for university research in the humanities and social sciences as well as the natural sciences;
-establish an integrated regulatory body for telecommunications;
-establish a Joint Committee of the House and Senate to consider questions relating to the future of the National Capital Region;
-preserve the national heritage by providing incentives for the purchase by Canadian institutions of works of art which might otherwise be exported; and
Speech from the Throne
-bring assistance to Canadian cultural enterprises by extending the provisions of the Foreign Investment Review Act; by promoting the sale of Canadian books and magazines; and by opening discussions with provincial governments about ways to increase the exposure of Canadian films in commercial theatres in Canada.
The health of Canadians will be a priority for the Government, with emphasis being placed on the prevention of illness, which includes raising the level of physical fitness of Canadians. A series of major athletic events including the Canada Winter Games in 1975, the Olympic Games in 1976, the Canada Summer Games in 1977 and the Commonwealth Games in 1978, should stimulate all Canadians, and particularly youth, to higher levels of participation and achievement in this area.
The federal-provincial Social Security Review is continuing on an urgent basis. Studies on alternative approaches to the reform of the income security system are expected to be sufficiently advanced to enable federal and provincial ministers to agree upon a preferred approach at an early date. Similarly it is anticipated that proposals for the reform of social services will have been agreed upon shortly.
Stemming the despoilation of our planet and returning our water, air, and land to a more natural state are urgent and challenging goals. Legislative measures toward these goals will include:
-greater protection from contaminating substances in the interests of human health and ecological stability; and -curtailment of ocean dumping through international agreement. The Government is also determined to continue its program of extending equality before the law to all Canadians. To this end wide-ranging legislation will be introduced to guarantee the equal status of women in areas within the Federal Government's jurisdiction. In this respect the Government is planning a substantial program of activities to mark International Women's Year in 1975.
Other measures related to equality before the law include:
-human rights legislation;
-substantial amendments to the Criminal Code;
-legislation to provide for royalty rates for oil and gas on Indian reserves comparable to those charged by oil-producing provinces;
-amendments so that the Supreme Court can deal more expeditiously with cases which come before it and to remove the right of appeal based solely on financial considerations.
There has been a rapid expansion in the numbers of people seeking to come to Canada as immigrants, as students, and as temporary workers. A Green Paper will be published shortly which will form the basis for public and federal-provincial discussion.
The volume of public business before Parliament increases with each passing year and this Session will not be an exception. The view is widely shared within and without Parliament that the rules and procedures of the House of Commons should be adapted to enable Members on all sides-supporting and opposing the Government-to discharge their growing responsibilities more effectively. The Government will seek, as a matter of urgency, support on a non-partisan basis for the necessary reforms of Parliamentary rules and for measures to be laid before you dealing with:
-redistribution of seats in the House of Commons;
-broadcasting the proceedings of the House; and -possible conflicts of interest of Members of the House of Commons and the Senate.
Amendments will be proposed to the Public Service Staff Relations Act.
You will be asked to consider other legislative proposals.
Members of the House of Commons,
The Government intends to present a budget early in this Session. You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
25,30,2,1976-10-12,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I have the honour to welcome you to the Second Session of the 30th Parliament of Canada.
I am proud to be able to speak with you once more after an absence occasioned by an affliction which forced my withdrawal from public life for a time.
I now have a better understanding of our human frailty, but I have also learned the depths of devotion of those who love us as well as the strength of the human will to survive.
I would like to take this opportunity to offer my thanks to all my fellow citizens who sent their best wishes for my health and who remembered me in their prayers.
The activities of this year have taken me from the grounds of Rideau Hall and across the country. Two of my engagements took me to Vancouver, for the United Nations Habitat conference, and to Montreal, for the Olympic Games.
The whole world was our guest for these two events, and I was struck by the contrast between those of us in Canada who are sometimes inflicted with morbid self-analysis, and those who come to us from other lands, and see Canada as a country truly blessed.
For the Olympic Games, the Queen and her family came to Quebec and Ontario, after a visit by Her Majesty and Prince Philip to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick; everywhere they received a warm welcome.
Next year, of course, Her Majesty will celebrate the Silver Jubilee of her accession to the Throne. She will be spending a few days in Ottawa to celebrate it with us, and to celebrate also the Jubilee of the appointment of the First Canadian-born Governor General in Canada, and the 10th anniversary of the foundation of the Order of Canada. This will be the seventh time in ten years that the Queen has visited Canada.
As we assemble in this historic place the day after Thanksgiving Day, it is Fitting for all of us to pause and give thanks for the remarkable freedom we enjoy as Canadians, and for those human and natural resources which give Canada a favoured position among the nations of the world.
Because of the basic underlying strength of the economy, and because of the co-operation of the majority of Canadians which is making the anti-inflation program work, Canada has better reasons for confidence and optimism than has virtually any other nation. Our storehouse of natural resources, our food-producing ability, our labour and management skills present Canada with growth opportunities which are shared by few other industrialized countries. The fundamental reality which will guide our deliberations is that Canada is entering upon a decade of opportunity.
It is our strength, and our conFidence in ourselves which give us the real opportunity to make greater progress toward those goals which all Canadians share-national unity, equality of opportunity, and the enhancement of individual rights.
I-National Unity
In order to promote that level of unity among Canadians without which we cannot be truly free, truly one nation, nor hope to achieve our shared national goals, the Government will place a very high priority upon the promotion of better understanding among French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians, and upon the achievement of formal constitutional independence.
Since 1968 the policy of ofFicial languages, supported by all parties represented in Parliamnt, has been based on the principle of equality, and on the right of Canadians to speak English or French according to their own will. An essential consequence, agreed by Parliament, is that the federal government provide services in the two official languages in the National Capital, and wherever else there is sufficient demand for such services.
The policy is one of fairness and reasonableness toward the people speaking the two official languages of Canada; and the Government is of the view that it must be maintained in the interests of justice and of the unity of Canada.
Canada is a diverse country. Unity can result only from a recognition of that diversity, and not from any attempt to impose rigid uniformity. In matters of language and culture, it is important to recognize the personality of the various parts of the country without departing from fundamental principles of justice and generosity, which should apply everywhere.
The Government has established programs intended to give real meaning to the official languages policy. Some of these measures have proven successful, and will be continued. Others have not, and will be modified.
Grievances originating from public servants through the Commissioner of Official Languages will continue to be reviewed, in order to fulfill the Government's commitment to ensure maximum fairness and effectiveness in the implementation of the official languages policy.
The Government remains committed to the enhancement of the bilingual capacity of the federal public service. However, it believes that a better balance should be established between the money spent to introduce bilingualism in the public service and the money spent to enable more Canadians, particularly young people, to learn to communicate in both official languages. The Government is convinced that a great majority of Canadians are dedicated to the strengthening of bonds among Canadians speaking our two official languages, and belonging to our many different cultures.
Canadians appear particularly anxious that their children have the best possible chance of understanding their compatriots of the other language. Consequently, the Government intends to discuss with the provinces arrangements to increase the effectiveness of training in both official languages in the school systems across Canada.
The Government also intends to increase programs to enable young people from various parts of the country to learn more about one another.
II-Equality of Opportunity
While it is essential to national unity that all Canadians believe we have an equal opportunity to be fully ourselves in a cultural sense, it is just as essential to unity that we enjoy equal opportunities for individual and regional economic fulfilment.
To translate Canada's economic potential into real growth and equality of opportunity, we must be both clear-sighted in our recognition of the obstacles which lie in our path, and united in our determination to remove them.
The most important obstacle is inflation; a destructive force which we all know can take jobs and income away from our workers, rob the elderly of the value of their savings, stunt the dreams of families for a better life, impede the flow of capital necessary for industrial growth, and obstruct the fight against poverty and inequality.
The continued reduction of inflation, and the creation of many more employment opportunities for Canadians, are and will continue to be the Government's highest priorities.
To create the climate necessary for the achievement of these two vital objectives, the Government will continue to practise fiscal restraint. The control of inflation will remain the single most important condition for economic stability in Canada, even after price and income controls are removed. Determined restraint in fiscal and monetary policy is essential to the long-term control of inflation.
The Government remains committed to a reduction in the growth of the public service. In the ten years prior to 1975-76 authorized man-years in the public service grew at an average annual rate of 4 per cent. This year the growth rate was reduced to 1.5 per cent, requiring actual reductions in 27 departments and agencies. The Government will reduce the rate of growth to below one per cent in the coming fiscal year.
In a further effort to reduce the size of government as well as expand the range of opportunities for private enterprise, all federal programs will be reviewed to identify those government activities which could be transferred to the private sector without reducing the quality of service to the public.
The international trading environment will profoundly influence our economic performance, and significant progress will be sought by Canada in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations and through other trade development initiatives. To support private industry in meeting greater international competition, the Government will modify substantially its industrial assistance programs.
The Government also places a very high value on the contribution small businesses make to the economic and social well-being of Canadians. Small owner-managed firms are a mainstay of employment in cities and towns across the country. They supply goods and services essential to consumers and to other business, and they demonstrate the innovation and entrepreneurship from which successful enterprise must spring. More than that, small businesses, and the people who own them, manage them, and work in them, are the economic backbone of countless communities throughout Canada.
The Government will introduce measures to assist small businesses by improving local access to financial assistance and other services provided by government departments, the Federal Business Development Bank, and Financial institutions in the private sector.
In response to concerns expressed by many Canadian businessmen, the Government will establish a better balance between the need for economic data, and the paperwork burden thereby imposed on small firms. The number of firms required to make statistical reports to government will be substantially reduced. Those larger companies which will still be required to submit information on a regular basis will be able to do so on fewer and simpler reporting forms.
In pursuit of the goal of a higher rate of employment, it will be necessary to improve the efficiency of the labour market and actively hasten the return of unemployed workers to productive effort. Adequate income is a pre-requisite to human dignity; and the Government believes most unemployed Canadians would much prefer to secure that income through worthwhile work than through public assistance. In some cases, and locations, this goal can be achieved only through direct job creation by governments.
You will therefore be asked to approve a comprehensive, year-round, direct job creation program, directed particularly toward areas of chronic high unemployment. Other programs will provide more job opportunities and improved employment counselling for young people.
The Government will not compete with the private sector for the services of unemployed workers, but will create jobs in areas where its efforts will be a necessary supplement to private sector activity.
You will be asked to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act in ways which will permit insurance funds to be used to maintain the income of Canadians being trained for new jobs, and to help employers retain workers who might otherwise be temporarily laid off.
To facilitate these improvements, the Government proposes the merger of the operations of the Unemployment Insurance Commission and the Manpower and Immigration Department, so that Canadians may obtain employment support services at a single source.
You will be asked to consider amendments to the Immigration Act, designed to promote Canada's regional and urban development goals, promote family unity, achieve a balance between immigration levels and employment opportunities, and preserve Canada's reputation as an open, tolerant society which welcomes the energy and cultural diversity of people from all parts of the world.
The improvement of labour-management relations in Canada is an essential pre-condition to economic stability. While it considers the collective bargaining system to be one of the important ways of ensuring fair wages in a democratic society, the Government and Canadians generally are deeply disturbed by the loss of productivity and increased social tensions which frequently result from the inadequacies of that system.
The solution is not to be found in excessive restriction of collective bargaining rights, but rather in the development of better mechanisms for settling disputes in a less adversarial, more co-operative manner.
The Government therefore intends to work with the provinces and with labour and business communities to develop a number of initiatives aimed at improving labour-management relations.
It is intended to establish a collective bargaining information centre, which will offer objective economic and compensation data to all parties. It is also intended to encourage greater participation by plant workers in decisions affecting their working conditions; to expand labour education programs; to develop a
voluntary code of fair practices; and to establish a national institution dedicated to improving the quality of life in the workplace.
An industrial safety and health centre will be established to assist companies and workers in their efforts to identify and remove hazards.
The Government will work closely with its own employees in various departments and Crown corporations to implement innovative, co-operative methods of improving health and safety conditions. In effect, the Government intends to use its own operations to test new methods of improving working conditions and labour-management relations.
Measures will be proposed to improve the collective bargaining system in the public service, to reduce the adversarial nature of the process and to ensure an equitable relationship between compensation levels in the public and private sectors.
The Government intends to promote greater freedom and efficiency in the marketplace, and thus reinforce the market system's vital role in the allocation of national resources among national needs.
Significant revisions to laws promoting competition in the marketplace will be placed before you. The Government is determined to preserve and enhance Canada's traditional policy of reliance on individual enterprise as the mainspring of economic activity.
The focus of the second stage of competition policy reform will be a strengthening of the laws governing mergers and monopolies in order to encourage a more efficient and dynamic economy; one that rewards the creative and the industrious; that allows prices to be determined by the free play of market forces while protecting the marketplace from excessive concentrations of power. The more effectively competition governs the marketplace, the less necessity there will be for detailed regulation and control of the economy by governments.
On the other hand, where competition is inadequate the Government must intervene to protect the public interest. For this reason, changes will be introduced to the National Transportation Act to protect against unfair freight rates.
There is a growing awareness among Canadians of the need for more careful conservation of vital energy resources such as petroleum and natural gas. The Government will place further emphasis on research and development of renewable energy sources and on means of improving the efficiency with which energy is used in Canada, particularly the thermal efficiency of residential and commercial buildings.
To ensure responsible development of our indigenous resources, the Government intends to introduce measures to regulate exploration and development on federal lands.
With a view to conserving the food resources of the sea, and improving the livelihood of Canadian fishermen, the Government will proclaim by the first of January its extended jurisdiction over waters within two hundred miles of our coastline.
As a further element of the Government's food policy, measures will be introduced to make more farm-stored crops eligible for advance payments. The Government will also work with the provinces and farm organizations to strengthen the structure and productivity of Canadian agriculture.
In the field of social policy, extensive federal-provincial discussions over the past three years have resulted in a new framework for the sharing of costs and for making social service programs more responsive. Parliament will therefore be asked to consider a new Social Services Act which will substantially improve the effectiveness of cost-shared social services in Canada, especially for the aged, children and the handicapped.
In response to the need for good day-care services everywhere in Canada, the Government will help to provide more and better day-care services by encouraging the provincial governments to adopt a new system of fees related to incomes. A great many more Canadian mothers who seek employment outside the home will thereby be free to do so, because partially subsidized day-care will be more widely available.
You will be asked to consider amendments to the Canada Pension Plan which would further recognize the value of the contribution made to the family and society by both marriage partners, in the event that one remains at home to raise children while their partner works outside the home, or in the event of marriage breakdown.
On January first, the indexing of family allowance payments will be resumed to compensate for the rise in the cost of living during 1976.
In the areas of medical insurance, hospital insurance and post-secondary education, negotiations will continue with the provinces concerning the gradual introduction of new Financial and administrative arrangements. These changes would not only allow the provinces to exercise greater flexibility in the provision of services, but would also serve the federal government's goal of co-operative restraint upon the rising cost of health and social security programs.
Of equal importance to the social well-being of Canadians is an adequate supply of affordable housing in a satisfactory community environment. Therefore, the goal of one million new homes over four years remains a key element of the Government's housing policy. In concert with other levels of government and the private sector the Government will work to increase the efficiency and impact of Canada's total housing effort.
The Government attaches continuing importance to meeting the aspirations of Canada's native peoples and, in particular, to the just settlement of their land claims. At this session, you will be asked to approve the negotiated settlement of claims in the James Bay region.
In the aftermath of the highly successful Montreal Olympics, and the gratifying results achieved by Canadian athletes, federal support for selected amateur sport and fitness programs will be further augmented.
This year, the Law Reform Commission of Canada submitted a report on family law which merits the attention of all Canadians. The Government intends to carry on discussions with the provinces to encourage the creation of unified Family Courts with comprehensive jurisdiction over family law permitting disputes to be dealt with more constructively. In addition the government will discuss with the provinces and with the public other aspects of family law bearing on the stability of marriage, the protection of children and the fair sharing of the economic consequences of marital breakdown.
Canadians are becoming increasingly sensitive to the fact that Canada cannot live in dignity as a nation while other people, in less fortunate lands, live in a state of deprivation and hopelessness.
It is not in Canada's economic, political or moral interest to allow the gap to widen between the wealth of the few and the poverty of the many. Therefore the Government will continue to participate in the task of shaping a new international economic order, designed to provide a greater measure of hope to nations seeking the opportunity to help themselves.
The world is now confronted with a broad range of problems of such complexity and widespread scope that no single nation or group of nations is able to apply effective solutions. Only global solutions will do.
Increasingly, therefore, Canada's international activities are being directed toward broad-scale co-operative activities. Human settlements, the law of the sea, environmental protection, food and resources production, terrorism, population growth, control of nuclear armaments, economic development-all demand shared responsibility and universal involvement.
III-Individual Freedom
In speaking about the Government's plans to promote greater unity of spirit and equality of opportunity both in the world community and here at home, it becomes obvious that the achievement of both those goals demands a healthy respect for individual rights, particularly the right of free men and women to exert a real influence over decisions affecting their own future.
At a time of growing complexity in public affairs it is especially important to enhance the citizen's right of access to the information necessary to make well-informed judgements and take responsible action.
The Government therefore places great value on the continuing work of the joint parliamentary committee which has been studying the question of freedom of information, and plans to submit a policy paper to that committee in the hope that early agreement might be reached on the best methods to improve public access to government information. In the meantime, the Government will increase the number and range of internal documents available to the public.
To the same end, you will be asked to consider a Bill designed to clarify the duties and responsibilities of the Auditor General of Canada, and to provide him with better means of fulfilling his important function as a servant of Parliament.
In a similar effort to remove obstacles to information and to equal opportunity, the Government will introduce a Human Rights Bill. The major effect of the Bill will be to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, national or ethnic origin, religion, age, sex, marital status, or physical handicap. In particular, the Bill will establish the principle of equal compensation for work of equal value performed by persons of either sex. It will establish a citizen s statutory right to gain greater access to personal records in federal information banks and to correct that information when it is in error. It will also limit the gathering of personal information by the Government.
The Government and all Parliamentarians are concerned about the extent to which the average citizen is informed about Parliament. The Government wishes to provide access to the Parliamentary process for as many Canadians as possible. It will therefore seek approval to enable the proceedings of the House of Commons to be broadcast.
IV-Role of Government
It is essential to the enhancement of unity, equality of opportunity and individual freedom that Canadians work together in a spirit of co-operation and mutual respect. To that end, it is important for all participants to have a well defined view of their respective roles in the pursuit of national objectives.
It is appropriate, therefore, to define the role of government in economic and social planning and action. There are some who acknowledge only a very limited role for government, believing that the market system allocates resources most efficiently for production and growth, is least wasteful, and most conducive to individual liberty and initiative.
That view is vigorously opposed by those who insist on a continually expanding role for government in directing economic growth, correcting the inadequacies of the market system, and assuring a socially acceptable distribution of incomes. This view asserts that government spending and intervention must increase to compensate for the failure of the market to serve social goals.
The Government favours a middle road between those two extremes.
This middle road represents a commitment to a society in which all Canadians can develop their full potential, a society in which justice, compassion, tolerance and understanding lead to a strong and united Canada, a society based upon individual initiative and marked by personal freedom. The choice of the middle road implies a reliance on the market to stimulate the growth Canada needs, together with an enduring commitment to social justice and equality of opportunity. On the other hand, that choice also implies that the working of the market must be improved and that less costly, less interventionist ways must be found to pursue social goals.
These choices have shaped the Government's legislative program for the coming months, just as it will shape appropriate policies for the post-control period.
Obviously, the development of the new strategies required by the times in which we live will demand the closest possible co-operation among governments, workers, businessmen, cooperative and voluntary organizations and all other sectors of society. To that end, the Government will launch a major series of consultations throughout Canada to secure a greater sharing of economic and social responsibility among all Canadians.
Consultation in this context does not mean simply informing the public about Government decisions. Nor does it mean an aimless search for the opinions of others. It means that the Government will place before interested Canadians its assessment of the major problems we must solve together, and its definition of the available options.
Parliament will have a vital role to play, as of course will the provincial governments and their municipalities. For example, the provinces will be asked to enter into early consultations with the federal government on the renewal of agreements relating to the anti-inflation program, and on the process by which, at the appropriate time, controls may be removed.
The Government is confident that Canada will realize the great potential of the next decade, because Canadians in all sectors of our society are opening their minds to the future, and are demonstrating a willingness to adopt the means necessary to translate opportunity into reality. Canada will make steady progress toward the goals of national unity, equality of opportunity, and the enhancement of individual freedom, because the people of this country have the courage to
tackle difficult problems, the will to take our own future into our own hands, and the wisdom to understand that we work effectively only when we work together.
You will be asked to consider other legislative proposals.
Members of the House of Commons,
The Government intends to present a budget in this Session.
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate.
Members of the House of Commons.
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
26,30,3,1977-10-18,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I have greatly looked forward to being with you here in the Canadian Parliament in my Silver Jubilee year. Whenever I am in this wonderful country
of Canada, with her vast resources and unlimited challenges, 1 feel thankful that Canadians have been so successful in establishing a vigorous democracy well suited to a proud and free people.
In this historic Chamber surrounded by the symbols and records of generations of Canadian legislators, I am very conscious of what Parliament has
achieved-by transforming the visions and ideals of a great country into the enduring law of the land.
In ten visits together to Canada spread over a quarter of a century-seven in the last decade alone-Prince Philip and I have met many thousands of Canadians in all walks of life, of all ages, in every province and territory. My happiest memories of our travels throughout Canada have been these individual contacts which have revealed the enormous strength and astonishing diversity of this nation.
A generation of Canadians has been born, and grown to maturity during my reign. 1 know you will understand when 1 say that I have a special interest in these young men and women, contemporaries of our own children. They are people made strong by the achievements of their parents and grandparents, but not imprisoned by the prejudices of the past. In their sensitivity towards other people, in their sense of justice, their generosity and good will, lie not only lessons for us all, but also the best and surest hope for unity and understanding among Canadians everywhere. I look forward in meeting more of them next year in Edmonton when I shall have the pleasure of opening the Commonwealth Games.
I have always been full of admiration for what Canada is: the new generation fill me with confidence for what Canada can become.
The growth of those young men and women over the past quarter-century has been matched by a rapid expansion of Canada's economic strength and international stature.
Within an evolving Commonwealth, Canada's influence is steadily growing, particularly as an advocate of human dignity, justice and co-operation.
This greater influence has been used by Canada to pursue such critical goals as a more equitable sharing of wealth and opportunity, the enhancement of individual freedom, the conservation of the planet's scarce resources, and the prudent control of nuclear technology.
The post-war period of sustained economic growth conferred great new wealth upon Canada. Productivity and standards of living improved substantially, and the country could afford to provide better economic protection for the sick, the aged, the unemployed and the poor.
But growth produced new sets of problems with which the world community has not yet learned to cope successfully.
High rates of unemployment and inflation are clear signals of the inadequacy of economic strategies appropriate to simpler times. They are also signals of the urgent need for important structural adjustments in the economies of Canada and other industrialized countries. More than that, they are the symptoms of an illness which can be cured only by a readjustment of our values, and by a re-discovery of the merits of self-discipline and fair sharing.
The process of change will require continued consultation with Canadians, so that there may be a shared appreciation of current problems, and a shared acceptance of strategies for the future.
The government publications entitled The Way Ahead and The Agenda For Co-operation were designed to involve all Canadians in the discussion of how best to adapt to changing economic circumstances.
The changes that are now taking place impose burdens on some Canadians, and the Government remains committed to protecting these individuals.
The Government has recently made new funding proposals to the provinces which will improve the efficiency and flexibility of social services such as the rehabilitation of disabled persons, day care and community development services. The delivery of these services will thereby better reflect varying conditions and priorities across the country. It is hoped that the response of provincial governments will lead to the introduction of a revised Social Services Act during this Session.
The human hardship imposed by the current level of unemployment in Canada is deeply disturbing. It is neither just nor tolerable that in this country there should be so many men and women deprived of the dignity of self-supporting work, unable to meet their financial commitments and plan confidently for the future. It is intolerable that so many are deprived of their right to secure and productive lives, and that their families bear an unfair burden of worry, uncertainty, and deprivation. On a national scale, unemployment now constitutes a very serious obstacle to economic growth.
The benefits of existing government job stimulation programs, such as youth and community employment projects, and direct job creation by government, are visible to all. New initiatives have also been taken to encourage the mobility and upgrade the skills of the Canadian labour force, and to encourage small business. But more must be done.
To stimulate the expansion of industrial activity and create jobs in the private sector, the Government adopted a number of initiatives in its March budget. The investment tax credit was extended and was also increased in slower-growing regions of the country as a means of reinforcing the regional development policy of the Government. Tax incentives were increased for energy exploration and rail facilities. The dividend tax credit was substantially increased to encourage investment; deductible capital losses were doubled; and businesses were permitted to adjust inventory valuations to partially offset the effects of inflation.
Legislation will be reintroduced to effect these tax reductions and investment incentives. But the current unemployment situation obviously requires further action. Therefore, this legislation will be significantly strengthened to provide further immediate stimulus to the economy and to create new employment. The details of these further initiatives will be announced by the Minister of Finance during the course of the debate which begins tomorrow.
Further stimulus must not be allowed to compromise our objective of continuing reductions in inflation. The Government will continue to exercise responsibility in controlling its expenditures. The continuation of the income and price controls program through the early part of 1978 will help to contain inflationary pressures, but controls on prices and incomes must then end. You will be asked to approve legislation to amend the Anti-Inflation Act to allow an orderly process of decontrol, as well as legislation to create a monitoring agency.
The Government is confident that the outcome of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations now underway in Geneva will be of considerable benefit to Canada. Consultations with the provinces and with the private sector will be intensified, in order to ensure that this benefit is shared by all regions of the country.
In preparation for the new trading environment which Canada will face in the 1980's, the Government will introduce measures in this Session to enhance Canada's exports. Further support will be provided to the private sector in undertaking large capital projects in other countries.
In the continuing implementation of its food strategy, the Government will work with the provinces to ensure a co-ordinated approach to agricultural development, making better use of Canada's food-producing potential.
As part of the Government's consultation process, a National Food Conference will be held. It will bring together representatives of governments, producers, consumers and the food industry to work together toward a national agreement on how Canada's food strategy should be further developed and implemented. New initiatives are underway to provide the consumer with readily [Mr. Speaker.!
accessible information on food prices and nutrition. The Government will ensure that the views of producers, processors and consumers are adequately represented on marketing boards and agencies, so that they may operate more effectively.
Several measures will be placed before you to improve the national transportation system. For example, new ports legislation will be introduced which will enhance local autonomy while maintaining the overall national interest.
In the field of energy, it will continue to be the determined policy of the Government to work with the provinces toward the goal of self-reliance, particularly by encouraging exploration and conservation to reduce our dependence on imported oil. Further encouragement will be given to the development of energy saving technology, of renewable energy sources, and of the application of solar energy.
There are encouraging signs that the policy measures introduced over the past few years to promote exploration and development are beginnning to bear fruit. In particular, exploration for natural gas in Western Canada appears to have been highly successful over the past two years. There are also encouraging prospects in the Beaufort Sea area and the Arctic Islands. Petro-Canada, in co-operation with the private sector, is seriously examining the feasibility of delivering natural gas to markets in Quebec and the Atlantic Provinces.
Exploration in the Arctic will be further encouraged by the proposed northern gas pipeline. A Bill will be placed before you to seek your approval for the implementation of the pipeline agreement negotiated with the Government of the United States. This historic agreement-which will launch one of the largest civil engineering projects in the history of the world-will provide immense benefits to Canada through jobs, investment, the purchase of materials and through easier and cheaper access to northern Canadian gas reserves.
You will also be asked to approve a Canadian Petroleum and Natural Gas Act, which will regulate oil and gas exploration on federally administered lands and establish a system of royalty payments.
The Government is committed to ensure that northern development occurs in a manner consistent with the rights of northern native peoples to negotiate a just and reasonable settlement of their land claims, and to participate in and shape such development. Consultations with native groups are continuing. In the Yukon, the Government will propose special measures to ensure that pipeline construction will not prejudice native rights or foreclose opportunities. In the Northwest Territories, the Government has appointed a commissioner to consult with interested groups and advise on the pace and manner of the further constitutional evolution of the Territories.
So pervasive are economic influences on people's daily lives that failure to secure economic stability and justice would, in itself, stimulate a sense of alienation, mutual hostility, and divisiveness among Canadians. In the context of the current national unity debate, therefore, it is imperative that feelings of linguistic or cultural inequality not be allowed to be further poisoned by evidence of economic injustice. Conversely, there is no doubt that the level of uncertainty evident in Quebec has a negative effect on the economy.
Few countries are as blessed as Canada, where a wealth of freedom and of this world's goods is apparent for all to see. Perhaps only those who have come here from less fortunate lands can appreciate to the full the great good fortune of living in a country so favored by nature, and so enriched by its cultural diversity.
Even in the midst of plenty, however, there are Canadians who know they are not receiving their fair share. To cite just one example, in those parts of the Atlantic Provinces where unemployment is particularly severe, some see themselves as an excluded group, able to gaze upon the good life only from a distance. There are many living in the West who have contributed much to Canada, yet believe their voice is little heard by others. There are many living in Quebec who feel deeply that Canada at present does not provide them with the opportunity to
fulfill their reasonable aspirations. There are native peoples across the land who are still in search of a better life for themselves and their children.
This discontent in such a wealthy country must find its causes in the human spirit, and it is there also that the unity of the nation must be found. A greater willingness to listen to each other, to understand each other's needs, a greater generosity between individuals and between different parts of the country, a greater willingness to sacrifice so that others may have a chance, to take less so that others may have enough-all these are in the realm of the spirit. All are essential to the unity of the country. Governments, of course, have a special responsibility to both encourage and respond to the spirit of unity by their words and their actions. Canadians are, I believe, coming to recognize the seriousness of the problem. They are recognizing the need to make a new and deeper dedication to mutual understanding and sharing.
The Government dedicates itself profoundly to the re-discovery of the spirit of unity. It wishes to learn from all who are interested in Canada and who have thoughts on how it can be made a better place in which to live. It is prepared, particularly, to work with the governments of the provinces, all of whom have a vital interest in a better Canada.
The Government recently appointed the Task Force on Canadian Unity which is now in the process of canvassing opinion in all parts of Canada. The work of the Task Force should assist Canadians to participate more actively in debate, and to make a greater contribution to the future shaping of the country.
The Government will also be placing before Parliament, and in this way before the people of Canada, later in this Session, a measure that will contain a number of proposals relating to the Constitution of Canada, which it believes will be of particular importance for the future of the country. The proposals will be concerned, among other matters, with the essential nature of the Canadian federation and its objectives, with certain fundamental rights and freedoms which the Government feels should be enjoyed by all Canadians as being essential to Canada's continuing existence as a free and democratic society, and with certain elements of the framework of the Canadian federation that are important to its effective functioning.
It is the hope of the Government that these proposals will stimulate a process of constitutional review in which all governments in Canada will share and in which Canadians generally will have an opportunity to express their views and convictions about the kind of Canada they wish to have now and in the future. We may confidently expect that, from that process, may emerge a new federalism that will receive the support and the devotion of Canadians everywhere.
The question of language rights is of particular relevance to national unity, and the Government has therefore welcomed the historic ""Statement on Language"" approved at the meeting of provincial Premiers at St. Andrews in August. The Government believes that this important initiative can and should become a basic part of our Constitution and has recently asked the provinces to consider this possibility.
After consultation with the provinces, the Government will amend the criminal code to guarantee the right of accused persons to be tried in the official language of their choice.
The goal of enhancing the rights and freedoms of Canadians can also be pursued through commitment to the principle of open government. An example of that commitment was the enactment of the Human Rights Act, and the recent appointment of the Human Rights Commission and the Privacy Commissioner. To the same end, the Government looks forward to hearing the views of Parliament on the Government's proposals concerning public access to official documents. In the further promotion of open government, you will be asked to approve the establishment of the office of ombudsman to deal with complaints arising from federal administrative actions.
The Government will also propose the amendment of the Official Languages Act, in order to make more specific its provisions respecting the language of work of federal employees, to strengthen the role of the Commissioner of Official Languages, and to clarify the role of the courts in safeguarding the equality of status of the official languages within the jurisdiction of the Government of Canada.
A comprehensive policy for official language minorities will be announced, and initiatives will be taken to ensure its full implementation within federal institutions. In the coming months, the Government will be proposing specific initiatives to be taken in collaboration with the provinces, and exploring ways of assisting the provinces in measures which they propose for ensuring greater availability of education in both official languages to all Canadians.
The unity of Canadians is often judged by the manner in which the federal and provincial governments work together for the benefit of the citizen, it is in recognition of this that the Government has recently designated a Minister of State responsible for federal-provincial relations, so that greater attention can be given to the search for harmony and co-operation between governments in Canada.
Given the new economic realities to which Canada must adjust, and the urgency of promoting linguistic and cultural harmony, it is readily apparent that Canada is now entering a new era.
It can be an era of increasing confrontation, tension and division, or an era of enhanced freedom, co-operation and unity of purpose. Fundamentally, the choice must be made by every citizen every day.
It is apparent to thoughtful Canadians everywhere that this is a time of great decisions for Canada, a time for re-discovering the strength and potential of a marvellously free and caring society.
That re-discovery will require that Canadians rededicate themselves to each other's well-being, just as I dedicate myself anew today to the people and the nation I am very proud to serve.
Members of the House of Commons,
You will be asked to consider budget proposals and to approve the expenditure of funds required for the administration of government services and programs.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
May God bless and inspire all your deliberations and decisions."
27,30,4,1978-10-11,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I have the honour to welcome you to the fourth session of the thirtieth Parliament of Canada.
During the course of the past summer Her Majesty The Queen came to visit Newfoundland and Saskatchewan, and to open the Commonwealth Games. She joined all Canadians in congratulating the thousands of volunteer workers who helped make the Games so successful, and with all of us she applauded the remarkable achievements of Canadian athletes at Edmonton.
The Duke of Edinburgh visited British Columbia as well, where His Royal Highness took part in the two hundredth anniversary observance of Captain Cook's voyage to the Pacific coast.
My wife and I paid an official visit to the King and Queen of Spain, who welcomed us most hospitably. Through us, Spain expressed its friendship and high regard for all Canadians.
As the end of my term of office approaches, my wife and I would like to thank parliamentarians and the people of Canada for the respect and affection which they have extended to us on countless occasions over the years.
We wish also to express our love for Canada. A great country is not created without difficulty, but to see it develop and grow stronger despite every obstacle has been for us a source of great joy and pride. Our faith in the future of Canada is stronger than it has ever been.
I: Urgent Action Needed
Parliament begins today a new session which will concentrate upon Canada's two most pressing needs. They are the strengthening of our economy, and the renewal of our federation.
Those two inseparable imperatives are different expressions of the same goal: to strengthen Canada through unity: to unify Canada through economic strength.
Seldom in the past have the seriousness of the challenge, the strength of our national will, and the scope of our opportunities combined to create for Canada a moment in history so full of potential for good. Such a moment, if ignored, may not soon come again. That is one reason why you should approach your task with urgency.
Another is the legitimate expectation of the people of Canada in these difficult times. They expect their parliament to respond to their most urgent needs with insight, with action, and with a minimum of delay.
You will therefore be asked to focus your efforts upon the priority areas of the economy and the renewal of the federation.
To that end, the government has prepared over the past few months a detailed plan of action. It is designed to increase confidence in the essential health and potential of the economy, and to strengthen the bonds which unite us in one Canadian community.
II: Economic Policy Background
The economic initiatives announced by the Government in August will intensify the assault upon unemployment and inflation.
Those initiatives will further restrain government spending, stimulate economic growth, and give more assistance to those in need. They carry forward commitments made by the government in 1976 with the publication of The Way Ahead. Many of those commitments were endorsed by the First Ministers' Conference in February of this year.
First Ministers agreed to help the private sector to lead the way toward accelerated economic growth. They also reached agreement on important medium-term economic objectives.
In July of this year, Canada was a participant in the Bonn Summit Conference. There the leaders of the major industrialized countries of the free world planned a co-operative strategy against inflation, unemployment and slow growth.
Canada pledged at Bonn to do its part to restore vitality to the Canadian and world economies. After the conference, that pledge was transformed into action in a series of policy announcements.
They require action on two fronts. The first requirement is to further reduce the growth rate of federal spending.
The second is to pare down or eliminate many worthwhile but low-priority programs, in order to free the dollars necessary for a serious assault upon high-priority goals. These goals are to stimulate industrial expansion, put more Canadians back to work, and further protect from the impact of inflation those who are least able to protect themselves.
III: Expenditure Restraint
Let us examine the first of these requirements, restraint in government spending. To achieve sustained progress in the battle against inflation, the government believes it is absolutely essential for Canadians to practise restraint in their price and income demands. The government is also aware of its own responsibilities. Expenditure restraint has been a central theme of federal policy and practice since October, 1975. It was reinforced by the First Ministers'joint commitment in February to contain government spending below the trend growth rate of the Gross National Product.
In August, the government set itself a more ambitious restraint objective. Planned federal spending this fiscal year will be reduced by five hundred million dollars, and next year's projected spending will be reduced by two billion dollars. As a result, the projected rate of expenditure growth during the next fiscal year is 8.9 percent. That is well below the forecast growth of 11 percent for the GNP.
The objectives of imposing more severe restraint on government spending are two.
The first is to encourage a more vigorous expansion of the private sector by reducing governments' share of the nation's wealth.
The second is to create a leaner and more efficient government, by making every tax dollar do more work.
The government is committed to reducing the size of the federal public service. You will be asked to approve amendments to the Public Service Superannuation Act, designed to ensure that public service pensions are in line with the level of contributions.
The government is committed to continued wage restraint in the public sector. You will be asked to approve amendments to the Public Service Staff Relations Act to ensure that compensation in the federal public service remains in step with the private sector, and does not lead the way.
You will also be asked to enact legislation making the Post Office a Crown Corporation, with a view to making postal services more efficient and responsive to public needs.
Because such a large portion of the federal budget is dedicated to transfer payments to the provinces, no large-scale restraint program could be successful without their co-operation. The government intends to negotiate reductions which will cause a minimum of difficulty for provincial governments.
You will be asked to consider amendments to the National Housing Act, the Unemployment Insurance Act, and other legislation in order to give effect to the program of expenditure restraint.
IV: Shifting Dollars To Priority Needs
The second major requirement is to transfer funds from lower-priority to high-priority goals. They are industrial expansion, job creation, and more assistance for those in need.
Providing those additional resources within the context of budgetary restraint is a most difficult and painful exercise. Worthwhile programs serving real needs must be cut back if the money is to be found for more pressing requirements.
By cutting back programs in virtually every department, the government intends to channel one billion dollars into programs of economic and social development.
In the area of economic development, the Government's recent proposals are intended to build upon its earlier initiatives to promote job creation, stimulate private sector growth, and encourage industrial innovation. Those initiatives included the April budget, which cut sales taxes in co-operation with the provinces, and provided a stimulus to non-conventional oil development.
Other measures were announced during June and July to encourage energy conservation and the development of renewable energy sources; to stimulate research and development; and to assist small businesses.
Now the government proposes to devote more resources to the promotion of industrial development in 1979-80.
The primary objective is to help establish an economic climate which is conducive to private sector growth, particularly in the areas of high technology industries, regional development, and the promotion of exports. Additional assistance will be provided for tourism and for the resource and ship-building industries.
Excessive government intervention in the economy should be greatly reduced over time by initiatives to eliminate duplication between federal and provincial programs and to simplify regulatory and reporting systems.
An important element among the government's proposed new industrial development priorities is an increase in support for major capital projects in manufacturing, energy and transportation.
The major thrust of the government's employment strategy is to encourage the creation of permanent jobs in the private sector. Special emphasis is being placed on the training and job placement of young Canadians.
In this new session, the government will take action to increase support for the training of an adequate supply of skilled labour and to assist labour market mobility.
The government also proposes to introduce major changes in the Unemployment Insurance Program. These changes would achieve a substantial reduction in the cost of the program. They are intended to minimize any negative effects which the program may have on the incentive to work, or on the labour supply.
The proposed adjustments would make the program more selective in its coverage. They would also put Unemployment Insurance funds to more productive use, partly to finance an expanded Job Experience Training Program for youth. You will be asked to approve amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act to give effect to these changes.
Other new employment strategy measures will focus upon year-round employment programs for young people. A new Youth Job Corps Program will be created. This and other youth employment programs will benefit from a major increase in funding during this fiscal year.
In the field of social policy, the unfair impact of inflation upon lower-income groups calls for further protection.
The most effective way to protect Canadians against the injustices of inflation is to continue to act vigorously to bring inflation down. This requires the co-operation of everyone, and takes time. But the poor cannot wait for that. Nor can lower-income parents with children to support, nor elderly pensioners. We must give them additional help now because their need is urgent.
The Child Benefits System has therefore been redesigned. Family allowance payments will be set at a base rate of $20 per month per child for 1979, so that more aid can be provided to those whose need is greatest. The base rate will be indexed in line with the cost of living after 1979.
Funds saved through this process wili be used to provide a yearly payment of $200 per child to mothers in low and middle-income families. Also, there will be an increase of $20 per household in the monthly Guaranteed Income Supplement. This will further protect the elderly from the impact of inflation.
You will therefore be asked to consider amendments to the Family Allowance Act, the Old Age Security Act, and the Income Tax Act.
As an additional anti-inflationary measure, the government has recently reduced the special excise tax on gasoline by three cents a gallon. Negotiations are under way with the government of Alberta to defer the one dollar per barrel increase in the price of oil scheduled for January first.
V: Renewal of The Federation
Economic improvement by itself, however, will not guarantee a united country. A renewal of the Canadian federation is equally essential. It was with this conviction that the Government published its proposals for renewal last June in a document entitled A Time for Action. Later that month, the government placed before parliament the Constitutional Amendment bill. It was referred to a Special Joint Committee of Parliament as a basis for a full public discussion of constitutional change.
A Time for Action affirmed the government's commitment to four basic principles of renewal: the preeminence of citizens and their freedoms; full respect of native rights; full development of Canada's two major linguistic communities; and the enhancement of our mosaic of cultures. It supported development of the regional economies and the fostering of economic integration, so all in Canada can share the benefits of our country more equally. Finally, it recognized the interdependence of the two orders of government, and urged the clear establishment of their respective roles in a renewed Constitution.
A Time For Action stressed the need for a less contentious relationship among the federal and provincial governments, and more effective intergovernmental consultation. Other goals are freedom of action for each government to fulfil its responsibilities, and measures to permit greater accountability by governments to their legislatures and the people who elect them. Also emphasized was the need to help the taxpayers better understand the intergovernmental process; and to provide more effective services at less cost by eliminating wasteful duplication.
The government therefore proposed to the provincial governments that joint action should begin as soon as possible on the clarification of federal and provincial roles and the elimination of duplication. The premiers have responded positively. The First Ministers' Conference on the Constitution, now expected to take place at the end of this month, will consider how best to launch this major enterprise.
With respect to the reform of the constitution, the government has set out only two fundamental requirements. The new constitution must provide for Canada to continue as a genuine federation, and it must contain a Charter of Rights and Freedoms, including linguistic rights. The government has shown its deep concern that real progress toward change soon be achieved, so that uncertainty can be dispelled and unity reinforced. In particular, the government believes it essential that clear and important progress be made before Quebeckers are asked by their provincial government to vote in a referendum about their future
Because there has been some misunderstanding about two important features of constitutional renewal, the government wishes to make its position clear once again. The first is the role of the Monarch and the Governor General. The government's view was and remains that the new constitution should describe the situation as it exists today in Canada, and the government is pleased that the provincial premiers expressed the same view during their meeting in Regina. Discussions are already in progress with provincial goverments to ensure that the legal drafting conforms to that intention. There is no intention to change or to reduce in any way the role Her Majesty plays.
Secondly, the government recognizes that the distribution of powers among federal and provincial governments is an essential part of the renewal of the constitution.
The government is prepared to begin the study of the distribution of powers at the same time as that of institutions and rights, and to give every aspect of the work a high and urgent priority. Discussions will begin at the meeting of First Ministers later this month.
However, the government believes that proposals on institutions and rights can be dealt with more rapidly than the distribution of powers, and that action on the former should not be held up if prolonged discussion is needed to settle the latter.
The public hearings of the Task Force on Canadian Unity have provided a valuable forum in which ideas could be brought forward and discussed. The government is therefore confident that the report of the Task Force will be an important contribution to the process of renewal.
In the course of the present session, the government will be introducing in Parliament a revised constitution bill. With goodwill and flexibility on all sides, and with the shape of Canada's future at stake, the government is confident that concrete progress will be achieved in the course of this session.
Neither renewal of the federation nor the maturity of our national structure can be considered complete until the achievement of an amending procedure permits our constitution to be vested finally and entirely in Canadian hands. In co-operation with the provinces, the government will again address itself to that question in the new session.
VI: Social Responsibility and Openness of Government
The government reaffirms its view that a renewal of faith in Canada requires an active and informed Canadian public.
It is therefore intended to continue consultations with business and labour, private interest groups, and other levels of government.
In addition, you will be asked to consider proposals to increase public access to government information.
In the further promotion of open and efficient government, a proposal will be placed before you to provide for the review by parliament of evaluations by the government of major programs.
You will also be asked to consider legislation to create a federal Ombudsman. You will be asked to consider other legislative proposals.
Members of the House of Commons,
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on the services and expenditures authorized by parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
May divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
28,31,1,1979-10-09,conservative,"Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I have the honour to welcome you to the First Session of the Thirty-first Parliament of Canada.
Canada has been honoured this year by visits from two members of the Royal Family. In April the Prince of Wales travelled to the west and north and to Toronto and Ottawa. In June and July Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother graciously undertook engagements in Halifax and Toronto. Members will be pleased to hear of Prince Philip's forthcoming brief visit this October in preparation for the Duke of Edinburgh's Commonwealth Study Conference in Canada next spring. Meanwhile in November Princess Anne will fulfil engagements with the Canadian Save the Children Fund.
During this year I have had a most memorable opportunity to reinforce my appreciation of the beauty, variety and natural wealth of our country. My wife and 1 have experienced the warm welcome extended to us by each region in its own special way. We have paid official visits to all ten provinces and the Northwest Territories, and we look forward to a visit before long to the Yukon Territory. We have also had periods of residence in The Citadel, Quebec, and in quarters made available in the Governor's House at Lower Fort Garry.
1 am proud, in my capacity as representative of our gracious Sovereign Queen Elizabeth II, to participate in this important ceremony in the life of our nation, which brings together the three elements of the Parliament of Canada, the Crown, the Senate and the House of Commons.
1 look forward to meeting the members of this new Parliament.
My ministers were given a mandate to change the direction of the Government of Canada, as we enter the 1980s. The basic purposes of that change will be to enhance the rights, freedoms and opportunities of individual Canadians, and re-establish the spirit of partnership and renewal which are fundamental to our federation.
The mandate of my ministers is also to build upon the special strengths of Canada. We front on one mass market and three great oceans, with access to the world. Each of our regions contains vast physical resources which can be the basis of industrial strength well into the future. Confident local identities are emerging-rooted in language, custom and community-and yielding a cultural vitality unique among nations. My ministers believe that the way to build a whole nation is to respect our individual parts, and you will be invited to consider measures to build upon the diverse regional and cultural strengths of Canada.
During the past four months, my ministers have made every effort to change the climate of federal/provincial relations which has prevailed in recent years. As a result of their efforts, there has been visible progress. An agreement on lotteries has been concluded and agreement in principle has been reached with certain coastal provinces concerning offshore mineral resources. Bringing about this change in relations is fundamental to my government's philosophy. Working with our provincial partners, we seek practical solutions to concrete problems.
To make federalism work, it is essential to change the attitudes of the past and the federal government must set the example. Accordingly, it is a primary goal of my government to bring about a new era in federal-provincial relations. Consultation and co-operation will be the hallmarks of that new era. The time has come to reconcile our differences. It is time to work together to fully realize our country's potential. It is by building for the future that we will renew Canadian federalism. In this spirit, my government looks forward to the next Conference of First Ministers in Ottawa this year.
Citizens and Parliament can control government only if information is public. You will be asked to approve freedom of information legislation based on the principle that government information should be available to the people, that necessary exceptions to that principle should be limited and specified, and that disputes over the application of those exceptions should be resolved independently of the government.
To correct inequities currently borne by some Canadian individuals, you will be asked to amend sections of the Indian Act, to extend spouses' allowances in circumstances where they are now denied, to amend certain legislation respecting veterans, and to further protect the privacy of individual Canadians.
You will also be asked to consider reforms to extend the power of Parliament. Proposals will be submitted to the Standing Committee on Procedure and Organization to strengthen the powers and resources of parliamentary committees, to accord more prominence to private members' initiatives, and to make my ministers more accountable to you. The standing committee also will be invited to consider the question of a permanent Speaker for the House of Commons.
To demonstrate the capacity of Parliament, you will be asked to approve the immediate establishment of four small select committees, with the resources and powers necessary to enquire fully into the special needs of handicapped and disabled Canadians; measures to strengthen the role of the voluntary sector in our society; policies with respect to foreign ownership, including the operations of the Foreign Investment Review Agency; and measures necessary to prevent recurring cost overruns on major government projects. You will be invited to establish a joint committee to undertake a broad enquiry into the future development of nuclear energy in Canada. In addition, standing committees of Parliament will be invited to examine Canadian cultural policy, Canadian foreign policy, and the retirement income needs of Canadians in the 1980s. Annual reports of crown corporations, the commissioner of official languages, the Economic Council of Canada and other similar bodies will be referred automatically to the appropriate committees of Parliament.
To broaden responsibility for the management of Parliament, Privy Councillors not members of cabinet and drawn from both sides of the House will be invited to serve as commissioners of internal economy.
My ministers believe the greatest immediate challenge facing Canada today is to restore growth, confidence and jobs to the Canadian economy. While our economy faces serious immediate problems, my government believes the economic potential of Canada is the strongest in the world. My ministers will propose a five-part strategy to build on that potential.
First, my ministers will reduce the burden of government on the economy by better controlling expenditures. A new expenditure management system has been introduced within the government to set strict over-all spending limits, to ensure that all ministers accept full responsibility for spending restraint, and to require that funds for new programs come from savings in existing programs. In that context, you will be asked to approve creation of a Ministry of State for Social Development to better co-ordinate social programs and expenditures.
My government has initiated action to reduce the size of the federal public service and to offer for private purchase and ownership Crown corporations operating in areas where direct government intervention is no longer necessary. Legislation will be introduced to strengthen control over and accountability of remaining Crown corporations. You will also be asked to approve ""sunset"" legislation to provide a regular opportunity for Parliament to judge whether government programs and agencies need continue in their present form, if at all. The form of the estimates to be placed before you will be improved to provide more accurate information. You will be given projections of government revenues and expenditures for the next four years so that you can judge the probable impact of today's decisions on tomorrow's economy.
Second, my government will place greater reliance on individual initiative to generate growth and jobs for Canadians. You will receive proposals for regulatory reform, designed to ensure that the certainty and nature of government regulation encourages individual initiative and planning. Measures will be introduced to expand research and development in Canada and to further promote exports of Canadian goods and services. You will be asked to approve agreements arising from the Tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations, including adjustment measures for industries adversely affected by those agreements. The Minister of State for Economic Development will convene a National Economic Development Conference to discuss with the provinces, business, labour, co-operatives and other groups, Canada's economic goals for the decade ahead, and how they might best be achieved in a spirit of full economic partnership. In that same spirit, legislation will be introduced to improve the handling of industrial disputes within federal jurisdiction.
Third, my government will propose measures to help individual Canadians build a stake in our country. You will be asked to approve a program of tax credits for mortgage interest and property taxes. Measures will be placed before you to assist small and medium-size enterprises, and to encourage more Canadians to participate in the ownership of public and private enterprises. You will be asked to consider revisions to the Employment Tax Credit program, the creation of a Youth Employment Secretariat, and other measures to create new jobs for young Canadians. An employment strategy for women will be placed before you. Programs to assist native Canadians to develop and apply work skills will be expanded. Changes will be introduced in the unemployment insurance program to ensure greater equity and to remove disincentives to work.
Fourth, my government will ask you to support programs which build upon the strengths of the regions of Canada. Legislation will be placed before you to strengthen the mandate of the Department of Regional Economic Expansion. You will be asked to consider a white paper on future development of our fisheries resources, prepared in consultation with fishermen, the fishing industry and the provinces. My ministers have begun to overhaul the grain transportation system through appointment of a grain transportation co-ordinator, the signing of agreements for the development of the Prince Rupert terminal, and a significant increase in hopper car capacity. A Seaway Advisory Council will be created to ensure that users and affected areas can contribute to policy concerning this essential waterway. My government will ensure an even flow of work to Canadian shipyards, as we develop an effective Canadian merchant fleet. Measures will be introduced to encourage further mining development in the Canadian north, and to strengthen the capacity of our two territorial governments to manage their own affairs. In co-operation with the provinces and industry, a national tourism strategy will be developed.
Fifth, my government is committed to making Canada self-sufficient in energy by 1990. To that end, in consultation with the provinces, measures will be introduced to encourage a significant reduction in Canada's over-all energy consumption, and to stimulate a major expansion in our capacity to supply and distribute energy in various forms. In bringing forth these measures, my government accepts and respects provincial jurisdiction over resources, as it accepts its own responsibility to ensure economic stability, competitive advantage and other national objectives.
My government views the diversity of Canada as a great national asset, and is determined to encourage, not limit, the development and expression of that diversity. That encouragement will be the beginning principle of the proposals by my ministers for consideration by the parliamentary committee reviewing cultural policies. It will be the purpose of an amendment to the Immigration Act to embed in its preamble the multicultural fact of Canada.
Legislation will be introduced to encourage fuller provincial and parliamentary participation in telecommunications policy-making. The Canadian Film Development Corporation Act will be amended to significantly increase private sector participation in the corporation and to broaden its mandate to encompass development of the recording and publishing industries in Canada.
Members of the House of Commons,
During the session you will be asked to appropriate the funds required for the services and payments authorized by Parliament.
You will be asked to approve a number of bills left pending at the dissolution of the previous Parliament.
You will be asked to consider other measures.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
May divine providence guide you in your deliberations."
29,32,1,1980-04-14,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I have the honour to welcome you to the First Session of the Thirty-second Parliament of Canada.
During the course of the last few weeks, both my wife and I have come through a period of convalescence and I take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude for the good wishes we received from fellow-Canadians from all parts of the country.
Canada recently received the visit of The Prince of Wales, who undertook engagements in Vancouver and Victoria two weeks ago. In May, The Duke of Edinburgh will attend the Fifth Commonwealth Study Conference which opens in Kingston on May 18. In July. Princess Margaret will take part in celebrations marking the seventy-fifth anniversary of the entry into confederation of the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.
Canada has very close and enduring ties with The Netherlands and I am greatly looking forward to representing our country at the accession to the Throne of Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrix of The Netherlands in Amsterdam on April 30.
I have had the pleasure of visiting all the provincial capitals and the Northwest Territories during my first year in office. My wife and I are now looking forward to certain engagements in the Yukon and in smaller communities across our vast and beautiful land. Discovering Canada and meeting
Canadians increases daily our awareness of the great natural and human resources of the country in which we are privileged to live.
We observe today not only the beginning of a new Parliament but the start of a new era. As Canada enters the 1980s, we confront serious challenges, but we look forward to even greater opportunities. Like our forebears, this generation of Canadians will be equal to the test. We will meet and overcome the challenges ahead for the history of this land has proven, again and again, that everything is possible if our will to go on building together is strong.
Canadians expect much of this Parliament. The country asks for action and action now. The first task is to clear the accumulation of essential legislation left from previous Parliaments. This backlog must be dispatched expeditiously so that the affairs of the state may be put in good order. To that end, my government is relying on the good will of members and senators of all parties.
This Parliament must also act quickly to put in place a program for the future. In the recent general election, my ministers received a mandate for a program which will provide security, equity, and opportunity for the Canada of the 1980s. In the course of that campaign, my ministers made a number of pledges which will form the core of this Parliament's work. You will be asked to consider a program of action designed:
-to respond to individual needs by promoting greater security for the elderly, expanded opportunities for the young, and equality for women;
-to achieve security of energy supply at a fair price for all Canadians;
-to promote a national development policy that will provide jobs, stimulate growth, build upon regional strengths, and increase Canadian ownership and control of our economy;
-to strengthen national institutions, while at the same time making them more responsive to provincial and regional goals;
-to ensure that Canada plays a vigorous part in the world beyond our borders.
All these commitments will be kept; these pledges redeemed; the mandate fulfilled.
The character of our people should inspire confidence in the ability of Canada to meet the challenges of the 1980s. We have the capacity and the imagination to make this a decade of opportunity rather than a decade of doubt. But there is one question which clouds the horizon and obstructs the view. It is the question of the unity of our country.
Will Canada still exist as a country at the end of this decade, or will it have been broken up by the tensions of our past and recent history? Will we continue to build our future together as Canadians, or will we give in to the siren song of regional isolationism?
In every part of Canada there are forces which are driving us apart rather than bringing us together. Canada's tradition is one of sharing, but in every region this principle is under assault. In the Atlantic, disadvantaged for so long, the promise of new resource riches has already led to squabbles about their future distribution. In central Canada there are some who fear that the economic strength of this region is somehow slipping away, and this in turn has led to envy and bitterness. In the west, many believe that their problems are ignored, their voices arc unheard, and their contribution is unrecognized.
To all these forces of discontent my government has one clear response. Canada will endure, grow and prosper. The men and women of this country have always realized that their participation in a society that spans the northern half of North America is infinitely more exciting and enriching than confining themselves in any one province or one region. The renewed federalism, to which my government makes a fundamental and all-embracing commitment, will not only strengthen individual and collective rights and freedoms, it will also ensure that Canada remains:
-a strong country, with first claim on the loyalty of all its citizens;
-a country that regards diversity as an asset, not a liability;
-a country whose people share their wealth first with those who need it most;
-a country that encourages initiative, welcomes daring, and promotes enterprise;
-a country which opens its eyes, its mind, and its heart to the larger community of nations, refusing to regard its own national borders as the outward limits of the universe.
Doubt must be cast aside, uncertainty must end, the forces of disintegration- whether they be economic or political in origin-must be opposed in every part of the land. That is why my government hopes that the referendum, to be held in Quebec some time during the coming weeks, will be a time when Quebeckers affirm their will and their right to be fully Canadian, a time when all Canadians will reaffirm their desire to live together in the country to which we all belong, and which belongs to all of us.
Because my government wants to strengthen the spirit of Canadian unity and nurture the seeds of renewal, it promises to interpret a vote of No to sovereignty-association as a vote for the rebuilding of the Canadian federation. My government also promises to give effect to a No vote by mobilizing all the forces at its command in order to ensure the renewal of the federation in a spirit of respect and justice for all.
I.	Putting People First
Canadians are a sensible people. They understand that these are difficult economic times throughout the world. They know too that Canada cannot insulate itself completely from the effects of global inflation coupled with recession. In responding to these turbulent conditions, my government will be guided by the two main principles at the core of the program my ministers placed before the people.
The first is that Canadians will accept sacrifice to meet the economic challenges of the 1980s, but they will not accept injustice. Canadians have always faced up to difficult decisions-and if necessary they will do so in the future-but only if the burden is shared equitably.
The second principle is equally critical. Canadians recognize the need to live within their national means and they understand that in doing so the state cannot meet every demand or satisfy every group. Therefore, in employing the limited resources available, my ministers will help first those who need help most.
In particular, my government recognizes the need to protect those Canadians most affected by unacceptably high interest rates. My government will act to assist those unable to bear the burden of renegotiating their home mortgages in the present abnormal situation so that the spectre of foreclosure will be avoided. My ministers are convinced that this objective can be achieved without the government embarking upon a major subsidy program. Farmers and small businessmen are also hit especially hard by rising costs, and my government is sensitive to their plight. To assist the individual entrepreneur, the ceiling for loans under the Small Businesses Loans Act and the Farm Improvement Loans Act will be raised to $100,000. Other measures of assistance will also be introduced.
Inflation strikes hardest at the old and those least able to take care of themselves. You will be asked to give urgent consideration to legislation raising the Guaranteed Income Supplement to the Old Age Security pension by $35 a month per household by July 1 of this year. This measure will primarily benefit single pensioners, the vast majority of whom are women. By fulfilling this commitment, Parliament will be providing needed assistance to over 1.3 million elderly Canadians.
Beyond providing immediate relief for elderly people with low incomes, my government intends to convene a National Pension Conference in the fall of 1980. Work must begin immediately to design better methods of providing flexible, portable, and secure pensions both in the private and public sectors. To start this process, my government will soon release a major study on the Canadian pension system.
One of the essential objectives of this government is to put more people to work. Young people, women, natives, and the handicapped face special problems in finding jobs. To meet the needs of these groups, my government will expand its employment program while using its resources more efficiently. There will be an increased effort to develop critical trade skills so as to better prepare today's labour force for tomorrow's jobs.
Expanding native opportunities and training women for new occupations will receive strong emphasis.
Members of Parliament will have a major role in advising on the selection of job creation projects, and my government will enter into a new partnership with voluntary agencies and local organizations in a program of community service.
Additional attention will be paid to the employment problems of the handicapped whose special difficulties cross all regional, sexual, and cultural boundaries. Amendments to protect the rights of the handicapped will be made to the Human Rights Act.
The role of women in Canadian society is undergoing marked improvement, and government initiatives must reflect and support that change. As a major employer in Canada, my government will play a leadership role by implementing affirmative action measures in the public service. My government believes that there is no room in Canada for sexual discrimination of any kind.
The serious problem of violence against women will also be addressed along with other amendments to the Criminal Code, and efforts will be made in concert with the provincial and territorial governments to improve health and social services for women who are victims of violence. It is time, too, to move cannabis offences to the Food and Drugs Act and remove the possibility of imprisonment for simple possession.
II.	Security of Energy, at a Fair Price
My government's energy policy is critical to the success of all its economic policies. Energy policy is as important for Canada in the 1980s as railway policy was in the 1880s. Like railway policy in that earlier era, energy development has the potential to create growth and prosperity across Canada.
My government believes that the price of oil in Canada must be based upon Canadian conditions and circumstances, and not upon the vagaries of a turbulent and unpredictable world market. We need a made in Canada price. A new blended price will therefore be established, which will progressively incorporate the costs of the Oil Import Compensation Program, while at the same time maintaining a single national price for consumers. The blended price will reflect the right of producing provinces and corporations to a fair return for their resources and their investment.
Discussions have already begun with the governments of the producing provinces and will be vigorously pursued toward an agreement consistent with my government's energy policy commitment, as endorsed by the people of Canada. My ministers do not intend to impose an 18-cent increase in the excise tax on transportation fuels, and the made in Canada price will result in a lower price to consumers than the one proposed in the budget of the previous administration.
A Petroleum Price Auditing Agency will be established to investigate and report to the government and people of Canada on oil company costs, profits, capital expenditures, and levels of Canadian ownership.
In spite of Canada's large energy resources, which put this country in the extremely favourable position of being a major energy exporter, we remain partially dependent upon imported oil. My government is determined to reduce that dependence by promoting conservation and by stimulating the production of new domestic energy supplies.
To improve conservation of oil and gasoline in transportation, you will be asked to approve legislation setting mandatory fuel efficiency standards for automobiles. Measures will also be introduced to encourage higher standards of home insulation, and the existing home insulation program will be improved.
In co-operation with provincial governments, other steps will be taken to encourage more rapid substitution from oil to other energy sources in order to substantially reduce the significance of oil in meeting our energy needs. Policies will be introduced to encourage consumers to switch from oil to natural gas or electricity for home heating. My government equally favors the earliest possible construction of a natural gas pipeline to Quebec City and the maritime provinces, and awaits with interest the report of the National Energy Board on this project.
Petro-Canada will be maintained and expanded as an instrument of public policy. My government has already increased the budget of the corporation by $80 million this year, and our national oil company will also receive a renewed mandate to engage vigorously in oil purchase negotiations and agreements with foreign suppliers.
You will be asked to approve a new Canada Oil and Gas Act, which will provide new preferential rights for Petro-Canada and other Canadian companies on federal lands, and establish new and more demanding requirements for exploration and development of these promising frontier areas.
An alternative energy corporation will be created with a mandate to stimulate the development of new and renewable energy sources to replace oil.
My ministers believe that, if given the opportunity, Canadian companies and investors would involve themselves more heavily in the energy field. My government, therefore, adopts the specific goal of at least 50 per cent Canadian ownership of the petroleum industry by 1990, and will soon take the first steps to achieve this objective.
III.	Developing our Economic Potential
Canada's resource base will be used as the basic building block of a vigourous industrial policy. A paramount objective of my ministers is to develop economic policies that will provide jobs, spur growth, improve regional balance, and promote Canadian ownership and control of the economy.
It is the intention of my ministers to continue the policies of expenditure restraint and improved government administration which were suggested by the Lambert report and initiated by the previous Liberal administration. My government will reduce the federal deficit in a planned and orderly manner, but not to the exclusion of other objectives such as reducing unemployment and promoting industrial growth. Improving the efficiency of the federal government is as important an objective of these reforms as reducing the deficit. My ministers believe that Canadians want more effective government, not necessarily less government.
Food and agriculture are going to be increasingly important to the Canadian economy in the 1980s. To further strengthen the industry, my government plans to create a Canadian Agricultural Export Corporation to expand markets for Canadian producers. A meat import act will be introduced to protect both consumers and producers.
Transportation is a vital part of industrial strategy. My government will ensure that the Canadian transportation system has the capacity to meet the economic challenges of the 1980s. My government regards the production, transportation, handling, and marketing of prairie grain as a national priority. Rail facilities will be upgraded, and port facilities improved. You will also be asked to consider, on an urgent basis, legislation concerning the transportation of dangerous goods.
In the fisheries sector, Canada's harvest is expected to increase substantially in the years ahead. To ensure the maximum return to fishermen and fish-processing companies, my government will undertake major initiatives to further enhance the quality of fish products and to ensure orderly marketing.
Licensing regulations will be changed to permit fishermen to benefit fully from the resources of the 200-mile zone, and legislation will be introduced to guarantee adequate investment in the fishing sector through partial cost recovery and reinvestment of enhanced earnings. To further assist fishermen, the ceiling for individual loans under the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act will be raised to $150,000.
Canada's capabilities in science and technology lie at the heart of our competitiveness as a trading nation. My government will encourage more young people to pursue a career in research through a new technology employment program, and will encourage and insist that industry do more research and development work in Canada. My government reaffirms its commitment to increase Canada's over-all expenditures on research and development to 1.5 per cent of the value of the gross national product.
To improve the ability of Canadian industry to compete abroad in order to create jobs at home, my government will establish a national trading company. My government also intends to make assistance programs more accessible to small business, to simplify application procedures, and to better co-ordinate programs.
To improve our system of collective bargaining, a Labour Information Bureau will be created to provide an impartial clearing house for the statistics and data required for negotiations. A fresh start will be made in the labour management relations of the Post Office by turning that department into a Crown corporation.
My ministers believe that the stake of Canadians in their own economic destiny must be strengthened. Government procurement will be used vigorously, in a manner consistent with our international commitments, to encourage the creation and expansion of independent Canadian-owned enterprises.
The Foreign Investment Review Act will be amended to provide for performance reviews of how large foreign firms are meeting the test of bringing substantial benefits to Canada. As well, amendments will be introduced to ensure that major acquisition proposals by foreign companies will be publicized prior to a government decision on their acceptability. The government will assist Canadian companies wishing to repatriate assets or to bid for ownership or control of companies subject to takeover offers by non-Canadians.
IV.	Strengthening National Institutions
To increase the confidence of Canadians that their national institutions can respond effectively to their needs, my government will propose a program to make Parliament both more efficient and more responsive.
You will be asked to appoint a committee of Parliament to examine the electoral system in order to ensure that the highest degree of representativeness and responsibility is achieved and that the confidence of Canadians in parliamentary institutions is strengthened.
As part of its commitment to renewed federalism, my government will revive the process of constitutional reform. My ministers are committed to the full development of Canada's two major linguistic communities and to the enhancement of our mosaic of cultures. My government will seek to constitutionally entrench a bill of civil and human rights, including language rights.
Members of Parliament, whatever their party, agree on the need to guarantee to Canadians greater access to information of concern to them. Freedom of information legislation will be introduced to provide wide access to government documents. The right accorded to ministers to withhold government documents from courts of law under Section 41(2) of the Federal Court Act will be removed.
Legislation will also be presented to extend the rights of access by individuals to their personal information held by the government and to provide greater protection for privacy by further restricting the use that may be made of that information.
Also, in response to the recommendations of the Marin commission, the RCMP Act will be amended to formalize internal discipline and grievance procedures, and to provide for an external authority to review public complaints about the behaviour of any member of the RCMP.
It is my government's hope that these measures will serve in the years ahead as a fundamental bond of trust between government and people.
V.	An Active Foreign Policy
My government takes office against the most sombre international background of recent years. Events in Iran and Afghanistan have done great damage to international laws and institutions and undermined confidence and stability.
In response, my government intends to conduct an active foreign policy. Canada will rely upon its strong ties of friendship throughout the world. Part of our international response must be a determination to increase the ability of the NATO alliance to provide security for its members and to advance the cause of peace, and my government is committed to doing its full part. In keeping with that commitment, my government has decided to proceed with the purchase of a new fighter aircraft.
But while recognizing the need for Canada to strengthen alliance security, the dangers of nuclear holocaust cannot simply be forgotten. If anything, these dangers are heightened by current tensions and by the continuation of the arms race. Canada's imperative is clear. This government must continue its strategy to suffocate the deadly growth in the nuclear arsenals of the world. We must, and we will, actively co-operate in international efforts to negotiate agreements on verifiable means of arms control and disarmament, and seek to rally others to a cause that is no less than human survival on this planet. To assist in this process, a new position of Ambassador for Disarmament will be created within the Department of External Affairs.
Before concluding, I address a special message to members of the House of Commons from the three westernmost provinces.
It has been said in recent weeks that the three westernmost provinces have no elected voice in the governing of this country. That is not true. Parliament is the supreme law-making assembly of Canada, and every Canadian is represented in the House of Commons by his or her duly elected member.
Like all of your colleagues in the House of Commons, you who represent the people of Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, have a responsibility to represent your constituents to the nation. You also have an extra responsibility in the present circumstances to represent the nation to your constituents. It is a task no one else can fulfil. My government is prepared to co-operate fully in helping you to achieve this.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
30,32,2,1983-12-08,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate.
Members of the House of Commons:
I have the honour to welcome you to the Second Session of the 32nd Parliament of Canada.
Canadians had the great pleasure of welcoming their Royal Highnesses, The Prince and Princess of Wales on an extended tour in June and July of this year. All who saw them were impressed by their friendly, out-going manner and their youthful dignity. As well, since April 1980, we have had the pleasant duty of hosting and meeting with fourteen foreign Heads of State visiting Canada.
We join fellow Canadians in looking forward to the scheduled visit to Canada in 1984 of Her Majesty, the Queen, and His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh, who will tour the provinces of Ontario, New Brunswick and Manitoba.
You recently completed an historic session of Parliament. The Constitution was brought home and with it came the final attainment of full Canadian sovereignty. The entrenchment of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms will forever help protect the liberty of our citizens. The vital energy and transportation industries are being transformed by the passage of the National Energy Program and the Western Grain Transportation Act. A co-operative national campaign to cut the rate of inflation in half was initiated through the 6 and 5 program. Members and Honourable Senators present all played an active part in these momentous events.
We meet today in a perilous time. East-West tensions are rising. Violence stalks many lands. The resort to force is a daily occurrence. The nuclear threat preys upon the hopes and dreams of every man and woman on the planet. The pursuit of peace must be the paramount goal of mankind. In this quest we must not fail.
For the past several years Canadians, indeed all people, have coped not only with the melancholy of the nuclear threat, but with the reality of the worst recession since the 1930s. This recession, which left more than thirty million people unemployed in the industrialized nations alone, is fortunately ending. Unemployment in all countries will remain too high for too long. But Canada has dramatically reduced the inflation which was the origin of this downturn. Our regained strength, combined with the proper mix of public policies, can now return the country to economic health and move us to new achievements.
So wc musi work for two goals central to the well-being of Canadians-to secure peace and to secure prosperity.
Abroad, the Government has begun the task of helping to construct a global partnership for peace.
At home, the Government's efforts will be directed to building a national partnership for prosperity.
To attain these goals, a comprehensive program will be presented:
to seek fresh approaches to world peace;
to encourage economic growth so that more Canadians can own a home, learn a trade, expand a business, participate in the ownership of our resources and gain a fair share of the abundant benefits this country can provide;
-to develop new partnerships among business, labour, government and other groups so that together we will build a better future; to preserve Medicare, increase pensions for the elderly, improve public safety, extend native rights, and further protect the freedom of individuals; and -to reinforce Canada's identity through enhanced recognition of our cultural heritage and increased support for our creative artists by new broadcasting, telecommunications and copyright policies.
I.	Canada's Role in Seeking World Peace
Thirty-five million people have been killed in wars since 1945, and the possibility of a major conflict is a danger no nation can ignore. In the four decades since the Second World War, Canada and its allies have sought to preserve peace through substantial contributions to Western collective defence and sustained efforts to resolve differences with our adversaries. Yet the current international situation is cause for considerable concern, even anguish.
The Government, in close consultation with our allies, intends to devote its full resources to exploration of every possible means to restore confidence and trust to the international scene. It will continue to advance proposals to slow the steady spiral of the arms race, halt the spread of nuclear weapons and create the conditions for greater security at lower levels of armament.
Canada will continue to make a responsible contribution to collective defence, in fulfillment of its obligations to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the North American Air Defence Command. The Government will maintain its commitment to 3 percent real growth annually in defence expenditure, thus ensuring that our forces are equipped with modern conventional weapons. Canadian forces will not be armed with nuclear weapons. Announcements will be made regarding conventional weapons procurement programs.
Renewed attention, too, will be given to the contribution Canada can make to peace and stability through peacekeeping operations under the control of the United Nations, particularly where local crises risk escalation into wider conflict.
Improving the climate among nations requires knowledge, creativity and a determination to find solutions. Reflecting Canada's concern about current international tensions, the Government will create a publicly funded centre to gather, collate and digest the enormous volume of information now available on defence and arms control issues. Fresh ideas and new proposals, regardless of source, will be studied and promoted.
Canadians want more than ever to become personally involved in the quest for peace. The Government will increase its funding for voluntary associations and private research groups interested in security, arms control and disarmament issues. Resources for research and development of verification procedures, the basis of successful arms control agreements, will be expanded substantially.
Economic progress is a crucial contributor to peace and stability. Recognizing the urgent needs of developing countries, the Government will maintain its commitment to overseas development aid. Canada will achieve aid goals of 0.5 percent of the Gross National Product by 1985, and 0.7 percent of the GNP by the end of this decade. Increased involvement of voluntary organizations and the co-operative movement will be sought in the delivery of this aid. Particular attention will continue to be given to the growing world food crisis, through existing programs, and the new International Centre for Ocean Development.
II.	Opportunities through Growth
Lasting employment for all Canadians wanting work is a critical national objective. Since last December, 353,000 new jobs have been created by the
economy. Through the injection of close to $5 billion in stimulus, the April 1983 Recovery Budget set in motion hundreds of needed capital projects across Canada, and helped make possible a return to much higher rates of private sector investment.
But even with a strong recovery, the Government believes direct action to create jobs continues to be essential. And young people are the priority.
Therefore, a larger portion of the Government's job creation expenditures will be devoted to unemployed youth and these programs will be delivered more effectively. Using re-allocated and new resources, a $1 billion Youth Opportunity Fund will assist young Canadians in acquiring new skills and in finding jobs in the private, voluntary and public sectors. In particular, substantial resources from this Fund will be allotted to a career access program which encourages the private sector to provide work and training to those entering the workforce for the first time. To intensify the Government's efforts for young Canadians, a Minister of State for Youth will be appointed.
While young people will receive special attention, the employment strategy of the Government will touch every group in society. Additional funds for this winter will be allocated to the Canada Works Program. Job opportunities in forestry, mining and the fishery will be enhanced through flexible uses of Unemployment Insurance funds.
Two new programs will be introduced. Canada's massive, diverse and vital voluntary sector will receive incentives to hire Canadians through a National Voluntary Service. A conservation corps-Environment 2000-will be created to employ Canadians to carry out essential tasks in reforestation and national park development.
Developing our Regional Strengths
Direct action to create jobs is essential. But the major opportunity for increasing employment is through the expansion of our industrial and resource sectors. We must reconstruct the basis for long-term economic growth and seize the opportunities provided by the recovery.
Wc must start by building on our regional strengths.
To ensure a strong national economy capable of providing jobs and meeting the needs of all Canadians, wherever they may live, federal programs and funding have already been re-organized in a new Industrial and Regional Development Program. It will support recovery through concrete initiatives, taking maximum advantage of the strengths and attributes of every region.
A new era of federal-provincial planning and consultation is being launched. Federal economic development activities will more effectively support regional economic opportunities and the reduction of regional disparities. To this end, negotiations are underway to sign comprehensive Economic and Regional Development Agreements with the provinces. These agreements will include such key sectors as agriculture, forestry, minerals, tourism, transportation and industrial development. The first of these agreements was recently concluded with the Province of Manitoba. Federal purchases of goods and services, worth over $6 billion annually, will be planned in co-operation with the private sector to maximize regional and industrial benefits.
An Aggressive Trade Drive
Canada is a trading nation and a substantial part of our future growth must be led by exports. To spur this growth, the Government proposes a series of policy initiatives.
The scope of the successful Program for Export Market Development (PEMD) will be extended to support service industries and to encourage private trading houses.
Under current import duty remission procedures, ""duty free export zones"" will be established for the manufacturing and processing in bond of goods for export; as well, the Customs Act will be streamlined and modernized.
Active pursuit of world product mandates by Canadian subsidiaries of multinational corporations, and the winning of additional export markets by Canadian companies, will be assisted by competition policy and direct funding.
To promote Canada's position as a Pacific Rim nation, the Government will move to facilitate establishment of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada.
While seeking new markets in the Pacific Rim, Europe and the developing world, we must continue to expand business and improve relations with our largest trading partner, the United States. Sectoral trade agreements with the
United States will be examined in such areas as specialty steel products, urban transportation equipment, petrochemicals, textiles and clothing.
Competitive World-Class Industries
To compete in the world economy, Canada needs to modernize capital facilities, develop new industries and rebuild plant and equipment.
A key element in sustaining Canada's growth and creating jobs will be the increased use of micro-electronic technology. Legislation will be introduced to confirm the tax incentives for research and development announced in the April Recovery Budget. Further steps will be taken to implement the technology policy announced earlier this year, including creation of a national micro-electronics design network. The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council will receive additional funds. A newly created Office of Industrial Innovation will work closely with Canadian industry to develop commercial application of new technologies.
The automobile industry is crucial to our economic well-being. Stabilizing employment in automobile manufacturing and its supplier industries is an essential task. The Government intends to seek a Canada-Japan Auto Agreement for the benefit of both countries, leading to additional production facilities and parts procurement in Canada.
Planning for industrial reconstruction and new investment must be based on busincss-labour-government consensus. Sectoral collaboration is at the core of the Government's industrial policy. Three business-labour task forces, on the automotive, aerospace and forestry industries, have now reported and are receiving responses. Another task force on the petro-chemical industry is underway. The benefits of such collaboration are already evident-in aerospace, more than 8,000 new, permanent, high-technology jobs and potential new export sales of over $20 billion will result from the Government's initiatives with Bell Helicopter and Pratt & Whitney. Additional task forces are planned on information technology, private trading houses, textiles and clothing, shipbuilding and a deep-sea fleet, and selected elements of the service sector.
Small scale entrepreneurs are the unsung heroes of the recovery. Small businesses are a perpetual source of inventiveness, valuable export earnings, and vast job creation potential. To assist this sector, an expanded Shop Canadian program will be launched. Access to federal programs for small businesses will be improved using the Federal Business Development Bank for delivery.
Tourism is a source of income for hundreds of thousands of Canadians and is particularly important to the small business sector. A national tourism strategy, developed in co-operation with the industry and the provinces, will promote each region's special features. Canada's attractions will be aggressively marketed both at home and abroad, and especially in the United States.
Young Canadians want to know their country better. Older Canadians deserve a chance to see the land they have built. A new Canadian rail pass, similar to the Eurailpass, and other forms of discount fares will be initiated.
Additional attention will be given to the needs of the travelling public. Domestic air transportation will be reviewed with the object of reducing fares. The safety of air travel will be improved through funding for a new independent Aviation Safety Board.
The Via Rail system will be upgraded through construction of new maintenance facilities in Western, Central, and Atlantic Canada. New trains will be developed for light density routes. Passenger services will be extended where traffic volumes warrant.
Building on our Resources
As part of the Government's thrust for growth, measures will be introduced to modernize and upgrade the fishery, forestry, mining and agriculture.
The Government of Canada recently took the lead in a restructuring of the Atlantic fishing industry. Above and beyond the funds for restructuring itself, nearly $200 million is being put to work improving fish grading, freezer facilities and for other measures of benefit to independent processors and individual fishermen. Funds for the fishing vessel assistance program will be increased for 1983-1984.
The fishery agreement with the Province of Newfoundland marked a turning point in the Government's relations with that province. It provides a promising basis for future co-operation in the best interests of Newfoundlanders.
The Pacific fishery-commercial, sports and native-is an important national resource. The Government recognizes that the problems of this essential west coast industry require urgent attention.
In addition to monies already provided for capital facilities, substantial funding to assist the Quebec fishing co-operative will be announced shortly.
Many Canadian communities depend on mining or forestry as their sole industry. The new regional development agreements will pay particular attention to the mining sector. The Government's forest renewal strategy will also be extended via these agreements, through the conservation corps-Environment 2000-and by additional funding for forestry research and development.
To help ensure that food production will continue to be one of Canada's longterm strengths, a livestock stabilization program will be established in cooperation with the provinces. Amendments will be proposed to the powers of the National Farm Products Marketing Council. A commission of inquiry will study the problems of potato marketing in Eastern Canada. The maximum for advance payments for grain will be increased. Amendments will be introduced to the Western Grain Stabilization Act to make it more responsive to the needs of producers.
Abundant clean water is a precious Canadian resource. Investment in Prairie water and soil requirements will expand, especially through the work of the new hydrology laboratory in Saskatoon. The Government welcomes the United Slates Government's increased recognition of our mutual problems of water quality. The negotiation of an agreement with the United States on acid rain will be pursued and efforts to reduce Canadian sulphur emissions will proceed.
Energy policy must continue to command the attention of Canadians. The framework for achieving our national goals of energy self-sufficiency and increased Canadian ownership was put in place with the passage of the National Energy Program. It now forms an integral part of the long-term planning of energy companies, large and small. Petroleum Incentive Payments, in particular, encourage both new sources of supply and enhanced Canadian ownership. The Government will continue its strong commitment to the NEP in order to ensure that our goals are reached. Legislation will also be introduced to confirm the Canada-Nova Scotia Energy Agreement-a stimulus to new large-scale development off Canada's east coast.
III.	Partnership for Recovery
In its early stages the recession, in combination with high rates of inflation, caused a deterioration in our sense of community. Each major group in society sought to blame economic decline on someone else. Later, however, Canadians recognized that to avert the downward spiral they needed to turn away from past divisions and work together to restore growth and prosperity. This new cooperative spirit has already produced tangible results in sharply reduced inflation, renewed growth, and enhanced employment prospects. But more is required.
The Minister of Finance has already begun a new round of economic consultations with provincial governments and other economic partners. Building on this initiative, the Government intends to introduce more permanent mechanisms of consultation. Regular economic outlook conferences involving labour, business, government and other interested parties will be called to pool information, to exchange views about the prospects ahead and to improve the basis for co-operative action. A new Industrial and Regional Development Board, jointly chaired by representatives from labour and business, will be formed to give practical advice on how best to implement the Government's industrial policy.
Work with the other economic partners to consolidate the gains from the 6 and 5 program of June 1982 will proceed.
While stimulating job creation, the Government will hold to a fiscal policy track which will contain and then curb the federal deficit as recovery strengthens. Administered prices will not be allowed to run ahead of other prices.
Following extensive and continuing consultations with the private sector and the provinces, the Government will introduce a new competition policy to bring market forces to bear in the continuing fight against inflation. The legislation will modernize conspiracy, monopoly and merger provisions, and promote the interests of consumers and small business through a freer marketplace. Amendments will also facilitate consortia to compete abroad for export sales and development projects.
To develop new ways in which co-operative, credit unions and caisses populaires can make even more of a contribution to the economy, the Government will support the formation of a task force. It will explore how co-operatives can work alongside the private and public sectors to pursue an expanded role in the fishery, communications, manufacturing services and international trade.
Opening the Door to Labour
Labour has been and should continue to be a full partner in the process of economic recovery. Workers deserve a fair share of the recovery's benefits and an equal voice in the resolution of issues like technological change and productivity improvement.
North American, European and Japanese experience shows that productivity is a co-operative endeavour, not a punitive process of seeking more work for less reward. Greater productivity results from a combination of progressive management, ingenious technology, and high employee morale. It is the main long-term guarantor of increased real wages for Canadians.
A system of awards will be inaugurated to recognize the contributions of companies, labour organizations and individuals to Canada's productivity and competitiveness.
New technologies are a major hope for improving the quality of many monotonous and dangerous jobs. Workers in such jobs welcome new technology that is introduced in a planned and sensitive manner and that helps to create a safer environment and more secure employment. A fund will be created for Labour Canada to support research into the effects of technological change and to conduct joint information exchanges between management and workers.
The Government has worked closely with labour and business representatives to establish a new centre for productivity and employment growth. Reconciling the advantages of technology with the needs of workers will be one of the main tasks of this centre. Consultations to create the centre are being completed and linked with efforts to forecast and plan better for future labour requirements.
This Government believes that the maintenance and improvement of workers' rights are fully consistent with, and indeed essential to, increased productivity.
A fundamental aspect of productivity is a secure, safe environment for workers. Changes will be introduced to the Canada Labour Code to improve occupational safety and health, to establish labour standards relating to sexual harassment, and to upgrade standards on parental leave. Legislation will provide for consolidation under a single act of occupational safety and health standards that apply to federally regulated industries, and for the extension of the same standards to federal public servants.
Selected Crown corporations and units of the public service will be encouraged to test new methods of co-operative productivity improvement. These may have wider application in both public and private sectors.
The framework for the accountability and control of federal Crown corporations will be improved and a bill will be introduced to confirm in legislation the Canada Development Investment Corporation to better manage certain Crown assets. Labour representatives will be invited to join the boards of directors of selected Crown corporations. For many years, there has been an exchange of senior executives between corporations and the Government. This program. Interchange Canada, will now actively seek labour participants as well.
Part-time work is a growing trend. Consultations on pension rights and fringe benefits for the part-time work force will be undertaken with provincial governments, labour and business.
IV.	Strengthening the Safety Net
The number one social priority of the Government is to reduce poverty among the aged. One of the first acts of the last session was to increase by $35 per month per household the Guaranteed Income Supplement. Indexation of the GIS means that this income has been fully protected against inflation. But more is required to help the single pensioner who is in need. Legislation will be introduced to increase the supplement for single pensioners providing additional assistance to more than 700.000 Canadians.
Beyond helping the elderly most in need, the pension system itself must be reformed to reduce poverty in the future.
The Government is committed to improving the adequacy and fairness of our retirement income system at the earliest possible date and in a manner that will not impede economic recovery. The report of the Parliamentary Task Force on Pension Reform will soon be published. Based on consensus, the Government will take steps to strengthen both public and private pension plans so that Canadians
can be better assured of security, dignity and fulfillment in retirement. Reforms to be pursued under the Pension Benefits Standards Act will include improvements in coverage, vesting, portability, survivor benefits, benefit protection and mandatory splitting of pension credits. Concurrence of provincial governments will be sought on changes to pension benefit standards and to the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans in order to ensure that pensioners receive comparable benefits wherever they live in the country.
The health care system is of central importance to all Canadians. The Government is committed to maintaining the equitable system, built up over the past two decades, for payment of medical care and hospital costs. It must not be eroded and eventually destroyed through extra charges to the sick. A new Canada Health Act will be introduced to clarify the objectives of Canada's health insurance system and ensure that universal access to health care continues.
Financial assistance to the provinces for medical care, hospital care and postsecondary education programs will be greatly increased this year. More than $500 million, above and beyond the $13 billion estimated at the start of the year, will be transferred to the provinces in 1983-84. This increased level of financial support, at a time when resources are limited, demonstrates the strength of the Government's commitment to maintaining the quality and integrity of our country's health services and post-secondary education.
The Government will continue its efforts to help reduce the long-term costs of health care through attention to preventive programs, health facilities design, indoor air quality, physical fitness and support for para-medical services.
New Protection for Homes and Businesses
Canadians require improved security against losing their home or business.
The Government recognizes the concerns of homeowners and potential home buyers about the uncertainty of future mortgage costs. Legislation and other measures will be proposed to further strengthen confidence in the housing market by giving greater protection to homeowners. The choice of mortgage instruments will be broadened. These measures should increase the accessibility and security of home ownership, provide a greater measure of confidence and stability to the homebuilding industry, and enhance the flexibility of the mortgage market.
Attention will also be given to the need for long-term farm, fishery and small business financing.
High interest rates have taken a substantial toll among businesses, and especiaJly among farmers, revealing important weaknesses in our bankruptcy laws. Revisions will be sought to increase the flexibility of these laws, to introduce a system of pre-bankruptcy arbitration for farmers, and to give greater protection to the wages of workers.
Personal Safety and Security
Canadians are increasingly concerned about the incidence of violent crime. Flowing from a complete review of the Criminal Code, legislative proposals will include increased mandatory sentences for violent offenders. Law enforcement to prevent importation of illegal drugs and trafficking will be improved. Stiffer penalties and procedures will be introduced to keep drunk drivers off our roads and highways. Support for voluntary crime prevention programs such as Neighbourhood Watch will be strengthened.
Victims of crime must receive more consideration. Greater flexibility will be provided to allow restitution to victims. Amendments to the Criminal Code will help speed up the administration of justice to ensure that victims do not suffer twice-during the crime and then during the wait for a trial.
Hard core pornography, which often emphasizes violence and degradation of women, has no place in Canadian society. The Government will act immediately to introduce amendments to the Criminal Code on pornography. It will also consider further legislation after receiving the reports of two expert committees, on pornography and prostitution; and sexual offenses against children.
You will be asked to consider revised legislation to create a Canadian Security Intelligence Service. A bill will be introduced to give full protection to the personal privacy and rights of individual Canadians in the conduct of the Service's activities. Changes to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act will provide for improved attention to grievances by private citizens.
So that individual Canadians and their communities can be better prepared for unanticipated events, the federal Government will work in co-operation with the provinces to give increased attention to emergency planning, during the coming year.
Securing Individual Rights
The Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Privacy and Access to Information legislation and other measures taken by the Government reaffirm our belief in the primacy of the individual. A bill will be introduced to revise all federal laws so that they conform to the Charter.
The rapid pace of social change in Canadian society has been reflected in a much higher divorce rate. You will be asked to consider a new Divorce Act to make this painful legal process more equitable and less complex. Work will continue with provincial governments to strengthen procedures for enforcement of maintenance and custody orders.
More funding will be provided for women's voluntary organizations and for research on women's issues. The recommendations of the Federal-Provincial Task Force on Family Violence will be pursued by continuing to allocate social housing units to provide shelters for the victims of such violence. The subject of day care has been placed on the agenda of a federal-provincial meeting of ministers responsible for the status of women, to be held early in the new year. A progress report on the decade since the United Nations' International Women's Year will be prepared.
Pilot projects will be undertaken to improve access to public transportation for the physically disabled. A national plan of action will continue the work of removing other obstacles to full participation of the disabled in our society, and Parliament will be given the opportunity to review progress in attaining this goal.
Action will soon be taken to respond to the report of the Parliamentary Committee on Indian Self-Government. The Government will introduce a bill to remove the long-standing grievance of discrimination against Indian women under the Indian Act. Funding will be provided for continued job creation programs on Indian reserves.
In March 1984, at the second Constitutional Conference on Aboriginal Rights, the Government will address equality rights, aboriginal title, treaties, aboriginal and treaty rights, land and resources, and aboriginal self-government.
V.	Pursuing our Canadian Identity
We Canadians know that our diversity-our lack of pressure to conform to a single mold-is an integral part of our identity. Canadian variety, tolerance and civility are to be treasured and nurtured.
If Canadians are not to be strangers in their own land, however, radio and television must both inform us and enlarge our horizons. To this end, legislation will be presented to implement the new National Broadcasting Policy. This policy will assure greater Canadian content on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, extend French language program services, improve international marketing of Canadian cultural products, enhance regional and native access to broadcasting services, and provide incentives for private production of programs.
In recognition of the proliferation of electronic technologies, new policies for film, video and sound recording will be introduced to strengthen the private production industry. Revised telecommunications legislation will also be advanced. Proposals will be made to change the copyright laws to provide greater protection for the work of artists, authors, and entertainers.
The definition of a registered charity under the Income Tax Act and related matters will be referred to a joint parliamentary task force.
Immigrants have always brought new ideas, energy, and talent to Canadian society. A new act will be introduced to give statutory recognition to the Government's policy of multiculturalism. To recognize the valuable contributions of immigrants over 65 years of age, most of the formal requirements for Canadian citizenship, aside from residency, will be relaxed for those over that age. The Government will continue to promote a wider knowledge of our two official languages, and to support the voluntary sector in over a thousand projects of heritage language instruction, offered to 125,000 students. The Government will give early attention to the report of the Parliamentary Task Force on Visible Minorities and will act to strengthen laws against hale literature.
Appointments
The Government will continue to promote balanced development of the Yukon and Northwest Territories, to settle aboriginal claims, and to foster the evolution of responsible government in the North. Funds will be provided through the Northern Oil and Gas Action Plan to ensure that northerners are involved in preparing for oil and gas development. In view of the need to sustain more permanent communities in the North, an early announcement will be made regarding the taxation of northern benefits.
The Government invites all Members to support its program for growth, opportunity, security, partnership and peace. The months ahead will be decisive ones for Canada. Special efforts will be made to consult with other parties on the timing of legislative measures. Constructive amendments proposed by the Opposition will be given full consideration.
Immediate action is proposed on recommendations by the all-party committee regarding parliamentary reforms. The Government will continue to take an active interest in the work of the Senate-House Committee on Senate Reform.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament. You will be asked to consider a budget. You will be asked to consider other legislation required for the resolution of specific economic, social and legal problems.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
31,33,1,1984-11-06,conservative,"Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons:
It is with great pride and pleasure that I welcome you, in my capacity as the Canadian representative of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, to this, the First Session of the thirty-third Parliament of Canada.
Canadians rejoiced this year in the visit of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip to the bicentennial celebrations in New Brunswick and Ontario, and to several communities in Manitoba. For Canadians the Monarchy is a precious link to the centuries of history and tradition that form our parliamentary democracy. The Crown symbolizes our democratic values, and helps safeguard the freedom and liberty that are the foundation of our system. The Queen as Head of the Commonwealth personifies the common bond of that association of nations and its ideals. An example to all who would serve, hers is a life consecrated to service.
Earlier this fall Canadians from coast to coast had the unique privilege of greeting His Holiness Pope John Paul II. The welcome accorded His Holiness expressed our respect and esteem. It also reflected the spirit of fraternity and generosity that exists in a Canadian society of diverse races and creeds. Pope John Paul's visit has helped Canadians to see anew that the enhancement of justice and peace can be a reality at home, and must be our vocation in the world. For this, and for his moral and spiritual leadership, Canadians express their heartfelt appreciation.
In these first months of my tenure as Governor General, I, too, have been afforded the wonderful opportunity to travel to the various regions of this beautiful land. The warmth and enthusiasm of the reception I have received from Canadians in Quebec, New Brunswick, and most recently in my home province of Saskatchewan, has touched me deeply, and I look forward with great anticipation to completing my tour of the provinces and territories. It becomes increasingly clear with each passing day that the confidence I hold in the strength, character and goodness of Canadians is well-founded and that we are indeed a rich and privileged nation.
Canadians take pride in the participation of the first Canadian astronaut. Commander Marc Garneau, in the Challenger space shuttle program. His voyage is the latest, and most exciting, of recent Canadian contributions to the conquest of space. We welcome the opportunity to cooperate with the United States in their space program. As a result, Canadians are playing a part in achieving the great benefits to humanity that space exploration can make possible.
In July, all Canadians rejoiced in the brilliant performance of our athletes at the Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles. My government salutes the hard work and dedication of our athletes, coaches and officials. Their excellence serves as a model of national achievement for all Canadians.
Reconciliation and National Unity
This is the inauguration of a new Parliament. Let it be also the beginning of a new era of national reconciliation, economic renewal and social justice. In this spirit, my Ministers will honour the mandate entrusted to them by the people of Canada.
While there are no easy solutions to the great problems facing our country, there is a new will among Canadians to make a fresh start in the search for answers. For the first time in many years all regions of the country are represented in a national government. The mandate received by my Ministers is a magnificent opportunity to build a renewed national consensus.
First, you must critically examine the relationship of Parliament with the people of Canada. Members of the House of Commons will be asked to approve the appointment of a parliamentary task force on reform of that House. The central focus of this task force will be the enhancement of the role of the private member. From that perspective the task force will examine and make recommendations concerning the powers, practices, organization and resources of the Commons.
Second, the massive undertaking that is the government of Canada must be made to respond to the individual citizen, wherever and however it touches him or her. A committee of Ministers headed by the Deputy Prime Minister has begun a review of all government programs. The objective is to reform and simplify the operations of government. From the citizen's standpoint, government will be made more understandable, more accessible, and more sensitive.
The taxation system will be made simpler and fairer and more accountable to the people's representatives in Parliament. The rights of taxpayers must be protected. In particular, legislation will be presented to ensure that no taxpayer has to pay taxes in dispute before an impartial hearing has been concluded.
Thirdly, a priority goal of my Ministers will be to breathe a new spirit into federalism and restore the faith and trust of all Canadians in the effectiveness of our system of government.
A constant process of consultation and cooperation must be restored. My Ministers are regularly meeting their provincial colleagues to eliminate irritants and to improve services to people where the federal and provincial governments have joint responsibilities.
My government's management of federal-provincial relations will pursue three basic objectives: to harmonize policies of our two orders of government, to ensure respect for their jurisdictions, and to end unnecessary and costly duplication.
National unity also demands that the two levels of government cooperate in supporting official language minorities and in fostering the rich multicultural character of Canada. My government is committed to ensuring that the equality of the two official languages-so vital to our national character and identity-is respected in fact as it is in law. My Ministers acknowledge the need for ongoing improvements and for vigilance in this indispensable area of our national life.
The reality of Canada is one of distinct regional identities, each rooted in many generations of history; of diverse cultures; of regional economic strengths: a country of many parts whose people share a profound attachment to one Canada.
My Ministers are determined to achieve a national consensus which will reflect that reality. A national consensus is also needed to reduce the persistent isolation of Canada's regions, to meet the challenges of economic and social disparity, to revitalize the strength of our traditional resource industries, such as agriculture, forestry, mining, the fishery and tourism, and to ensure that our critical transportation and communication links better serve the national purpose.
Ultimately such a new consensus must be reflected in the fundamental law of our land, for it is obvious that the constitutional agreement is incomplete so long as Quebec is not part of an accord. While their principal obligations are to achieve economic renewal, my Ministers will work to create the conditions that will make possible the achievement of this essential accord. In this work, the cooperation of all partners in Confederation will be necessary.
Their generous cooperation is also needed to honour the commitment to Canada's aboriginal peoples contained in the Constitution Act of 1982. For these peoples, as for all Canadians, the high expectations that attended the act of patriation must not be disappointed.
Reconciliation and Economic Consensus Building
Nowhere is the need for national reconciliation more urgent that in Canada's economic life. Our repeated failure in recent years to achieve our economic potential cries out for correction by a truly sustained, co-operative and national effort. First Ministers will meet next week to discuss the agenda for a First Ministers' Conference on the Economy. My government will soon announce the date of a national Economic Summit to bring together important groups in our economy.
Thus are my Ministers embarked on the long, complex and painstaking road of building a national economic consensus. The national Economic Summit will not be the culmination of this process, but its beginning. At the table will be representatives of groups such as consumers, women, native peoples, business,
labour and government. Their goal is to establish a new and productive climate and context for economic decision-making in Canada.
In this regard, there can be no doubt of the importance or legitimacy of the trade union movement in Canada, or of the desirability of both management and labour playing a critical role in the consultative process through which the new national agenda is established.
Discussion of certain economic priorities, an understanding of the respective roles of the principal economic partners, a commitment to some immediate courses of action: such an outcome would make the Economic Summit a success.
Future summits could address in more detail issues such as the enhancement of productivity, and the responsibilities of industry, labour and government in training and technology. Over time, mutual confidence and a sense of shared responsibility for our national economy must lead to consensus on even more basic issues: how to share the benefits of economic growth, how to share the burdens of economic adjustment, how to preserve the integrity of our unique natural environment, and how to ensure that the ideal of social justice is pursued through programs that meet contemporary needs and circumstances.
In the absence of a national consensus, economic under-achievement would be Canada's misfortune for many years to come. The process of consensus-building will engage the private sector partners in consultation and cooperation on economic goals. In such a context, government would act as guide, mediator and catalyst, becoming less intrusive in the private sector but vigilant over the integrity of the national economy and of national standards.
Economic Renewal: A Three Part Strategy
The process of consensus building will take time. Meanwhile there are some important initial steps that the federal government can take to help generate economic renewal. The three-part strategy of my Ministers is to restore fiscal responsibility, remove obstacles to growth, and encourage new investment.
Later this week the Minister of Finance will describe in detail the state of the economy and of federal public finances. He will announce a plan designed to reduce the deficit in an orderly, balanced and fair manner, and to control the growing burden of the public debt.
That we must deal urgently with the deficit is beyond dispute. If allowed to continue to grow out of control, it will consume our available financial resources, undermine our capacity to respond to new opportunities, put increased pressure on interest rates, and inhibit investment and growth in our economy.
Second, my government will pursue approaches to improve the efficiency and flexibility of our capital markets; to improve job opportunities for Canadians through responsive market-oriented training programs; and to increase investments in research and development to improve our productivity. Proposals will be placed before you to improve the market environment by changes in competition laws and the regulatory framework of the financial services industry.
Third, my government will introduce for consideration during this session proposals to enhance risk taking, innovation and reward among entrepreneurs, especially in the small and medium-sized business sector.
Initiative will be taken to stimulate both domestic and foreign investment. My government is determined to regain Canada's reputation as a reliable and profitable place to do business.
This three-part strategy is aimed at renewing economic growth in order to provide the jobs our people need and to address the continuing tragedy of youth unemployment. My government views unemployment as Canada's most debilitating problem and most critical national challenge. For this reason the need to stimulate job-creating investment is urgent. My Ministers will be taking action to address these compelling issues.
My government recognizes that measures to improve and expand skill training and retraining are essential elements of a sound approach to providing job opportunities. During this session, you will be asked to consider an innovative employment strategy that will be cost effective and oriented to the private sector. It will be introduced following intensive consultations with the provinces, labour and business.
Social Justice
My government is determined to ensure that social justice in Canada keeps pace with the changing needs and circumstances of our people. In this respect the most significant development of recent years is the greater participation of the women of Canada and their rightful claim to equality with men everywhere in our society.
As the women of Canada know, there is some distance between the principle of equality, widely accepted, and its reality, still far short of achievement. It is the duty of Parliament and government to help ensure that Canadian society travels that distance as quickly as possible. This will sometimes require the exercise of your power, and it will always need the power of your example.
Economic equality is the vehicle through which women will come to full partnership and participation with men in our society. Parliament has committed the federal jurisdiction to equal pay for work of equal value. My government agrees that this concept is one of the keys to the achievement of economic equality for women. My Ministers will enlist the cooperation of women and men in the private and public sectors in seeking to define further and to implement this concept. My government will also accelerate efforts to increase employment opportunities for women in the federal government and its agencies, boards and corporations.
You will be asked to consider a number of important legislative initiatives, including removal of the discriminatory clauses in the Indian Act, amendments to the Divorce Act, and measures to control pornography and sexually abusive broadcasting. My Ministers will shortly be initiating discussions with the provinces to establish a national system for the enforcement of maintenance orders. In consultation with the provinces, my government will take action to provide additional assistance to the victims of family violence.
My government has as a high priority measures to support and strengthen the Canadian family, which is the cornerstone of our society. The need for accessible and affordable child care has in recent years come to the forefront of the social agenda facing Canada. In an effort to reach a national consensus on options in this area, you will be asked to establish a parliamentary task force on the future of child care in Canada.
Canadians value and support the comprehensive social security system that has been put in place over many years by the federal and provincial governments. Many areas of this system must be strengthened to respond to the changing nature and needs of our society. It is time to recognize also the responsibility we all share to bring those amongst us who suffer from physical and mental disabilities into the productive mainstream of Canadian life.
My government will enter discussions with the provinces aimed at a comprehensive overhaul of the Canadian pension system, including such matters as portability, vesting, survivors' benefits, and pension coverage of women. An important element of this approach will be the consideration of measures designed to encourage Canadians to save for their retirement.
Consultations will also begin with the provinces to consider the most effective means of providing increased federal support for the improvement of community-based health care.
During the coming session, you will be asked to consider legislation to extend the income tested spouse's allowance to widows and widowers aged 60 to 64 regardless of the age of their spouse at death. My Ministers will introduce measures to improve the financial situation of Canada's war veterans.
As a country rich in human resources, Canada owes much to those who have dedicated themselves to cultural, artistic and athletic endeavour. In a variety of areas, my government will be addressing itself to the challenge of encouraging those individuals who inspire Canadians to new levels of excellence.
Law and Public Safety
Canadians are deeply troubled by the incidence of crime, especially crimes of violence, in our society. Most abhorrent to a nation respectful of the law are acts of violence against guardians of the law whom we have appointed to protect us. The recent murders of several policemen in Canada have shocked our people. Parliament shares the sense of sadness and loss felt by the families and colleagues of those policemen who died on duty.
There have been many studies of the corrections system in recent years and there have been numerous successful reforms. But it is obvious that there are grave defects in the system and my government accepts its responsibility to rectify these quickly. Legislation will therefore be placed before you to eliminate certain problems and abuses in the corrections system. Meanwhile administrative measures are being taken to protect better the public and the public's peace officers.
Speech from the Throne
During this session, Parliament will be asked to consider amendments to the Criminal Code to deal more effectively with impaired driving, soliciting, computer crime, and sentencing. We will work closely with the provinces in the areas of family law, crime prevention and assistance to victims of crime.
In the longer term, my government will address, in cooperation with the provinces, other anomalies in the fields of criminal and corrections law that are causing much public concern.
Renewed Canadian Internationalism
In Canada's past there is a luminous tradition of internationalism. Canadians have fought in two World Wars and in the United Nations action in Korea. Our armed forces have served in peacekeeping roles in distant lands. Our statesmen have been at the forefront in the founding of NATO and in the quest for arms control. Our country has successfully championed racial equality at critical moments in the life of the Commonwealth, and through private and public agencies contributed to international development.
It is the purpose of my government to renew this tradition of constructive Canadian internationalism.
Our relationship with the United States affects virtually every aspect of our national life. It is essential to our security and prosperity. It expresses values shared by the free peoples of our two nations. Beneath the myriad of issues to be discussed and conflicts to be resolved, beyond the hundreds of points of contact that take place daily between two governments and two economies, there are wellsprings of trust between two peoples.
My government has taken the initiative to restore a spirit of goodwill and true partnership between Canada and the United States. My government is pleased by the positive response it has received in both the government and private sectors of the United States.
There are many areas where the national interests or the national policies of the two countries diverge or compete. There are, as well, numerous and as of yet untapped possibilities for fruitful cooperation between our two countries. Restoring a climate of goodwill between our governments was an essential step towards the resolution of our conflicts and the realization of our opportunities. My government views this initiative as a confirmation of our national strength and maturity.
Vital as our relationship with the United States is, my Ministers are determined that Canadian internationalism will again be active and constructive in the wider world. The main objectives of my government are clear: to defend freedom and preserve peace; to prevent nuclear confrontation; to improve trading relations; to build a healthier world economy. For Canada, the way to these objectives lies in concerted action with other nations in every part of the world- allies, economic partners, competitors, friends and adversaries. There is surely none with whom a measure of common ground cannot be sought and found in the pursuit of these humane objectives.
My government is determined that Canada will again play its full part in the defence systems of NATO. Only in this way do we earn the right to full consultation and participation in the policies of that alliance. From this prudent and responsible position, Canada will work unceasingly with other nations, in every available forum, to halt the spread of nuclear weapons and prevent their development and use. Patience and perseverance we will need, for in this endeavor even the smallest progress is worthy of the greatest effort.
Canada's opportunity to influence the course of world events lies primarily in sound multilateral institutions. This is as true of economics as it is of defence, of development, and of disarmament.
Canada cannot prosper without international trade. The dominant part played by trade with the United States is obvious, and my government is exploring with our neighbour new approaches to a better and mutually advantageous trading relationship. But geography has also endowed Canada with an oceanic link to the promising new horizons of the Pacific Rim and to our traditional trading partners in Western Europe. My government will pursue with vigour and imagination new opportunities in these areas.
Canada also has a vital stake in the elimination of barriers to trade, commerce and investment on a global basis. In this connection, there is an urgent need for a concerted attack on non-tariff barriers which have become increasingly insidious and more prevalent. Acknowledging that no country, including Canada, is blameless, my government declares its willingness to do its part in a renewed multilateral effort to remove these obstructions in the international marketplace.
Internal Economy Commission
Canada's record in official development assistance has on the whole been constructive. My government recognizes the continuing need for these programs, including support for the cost-effective and valuable humanitarian work done internationally by our voluntary and non-governmental organizations. But it is striking to observe how much hardship has occurred, how much debt burden has increased, how much economic activity has been held back in developing countries because of world recession, unstable markets and trade barriers. A successful attack on these problems will accelerate economic development and social progress in many of these countries. The alleviation of unconscionable human misery will result.
During this session, you will be asked to address this and other commitments and responsibilities of Canada in the world. A special parliamentary committee will conduct a full review of the main components and objectives of our international relations.
My government is convinced that Canada's defence forces urgently require a new definition of their role in keeping with present day conditions. The strategic context in which we defend our own territory and that of our allies has changed considerably since the early 1970s, when the government last carefully considered this matter. My Ministers are undertaking a comprehensive examination of these matters. The purpose is to clarify the mandate of our military and to give them the resources they need to do their job.
A Time For Renewal
This new Parliament is an historic opportunity to overcome past divisions in our country, and to purge the spirit of confrontation from the conduct of the nation's affairs.
The purpose of my government is to renew the confidence of Canadians that Parliament is truly the voice of the people, that government is their servant, and that federalism is the means to harmonize and preserve the splendid diversity of this land.
Above all, my government will enlist the active support and participation of Canadians themselves as we search for a new way of addressing our national responsibilities: a consensus in our economic life, tolerance in our national life, and a deep commitment to social justice and peace, at home and in the rest of world.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required for the services and payments authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons:
In the great tasks of national reconciliation, economic renewal, and social justice to which you are called in this Parliament, may Divine Providence guide your every effort."
32,33,2,1986-10-02,conservative,"Ladies and gentlemen, Honourable Members of the Senate,
Ladies and gentlemen, Members of the House of Commons:
It is with pleasure that I welcome you to the Second Session of the thirty-third Parliament of Canada and express to you, on behalf of all our fellow-Canadians, my appreciation and gratitude for the work which you do here. It is you, above all others, who make our Parliamentary system work, and you who are responsible for ensuring the smooth operation of an institution which is essential to the welfare of Canadians and the unimpeded enjoyment of our freedoms.
Expo '86 has been a focus of international attention that has brought pride and joy to millions of Canadians. The success of British Columbia's world exposition strikingly demonstrates the creative skills of our people.
I have had the honour of presenting my respects, and yours, to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth on the occasion of her sixtieth birthday. At this time I conveyed to her Canada's feelings of loyalty. The warm affection accorded their Royal
Highnesses, the Prince and Princess of Wales-so evident during their visit to Expo '86-again reminds us of the vitality of the monarchy and its enduring contribution to Canadian life. I have also had the opportunity to be present at the marriage of Their Royal Highnesses, the Duke and Duchess of York, and to receive here the visit of Her Majesty the Queen Mother, who once again charmed us with her intelligence and her amazing vitality. You may rest assured that I have, on these memorable occasions, given renewed expression to the respect which we all feel.
Two years ago, my government received a national mandate-a mandate for reform. It was a mandate that summoned Canada to the tasks of national reconciliation, economic renewal, social justice, and to a constructive internationalism. Today, my Ministers believe these goals are within reach.
We live today in a world of increasing uncertainty and interdependence. We live in a world where unforeseen events, both at home and abroad, demand flexibility and adaptiveness.
Although my government will remain sensitive to changing circumstances, it is determined to pursue these national objectives in the confidence that their fulfillment will bring lasting benefit to all Canadians.
Canadian agriculture is a vital part of our national economy. Aware of the present difficulties, my government will work in close consultation with provincial governments and farm organizations to help alleviate personal hardship in our farm communities.
The Government has already taken special steps to lower farm input costs, improve stabilization programs, and help farmers in financial difficulty.
In the past, regrettably, agriculture has not been a priority in international trade negotiations. My government placed this issue on the agenda of the Economic Summit in Tokyo, and helped secure unanimous agreement to address subsidies in the new round of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations.
In meeting its commitment to Canadian agriculture, my government will spare no effort in seeking to protect the interests of Canada's farming community in the face of unfair pricing and subsidy practices conducted beyond our borders.
My government has acted to enhance the effective operation of Canada s energy industry, by negotiating the Western, the Atlantic, and the Nova Scotia accords and by taking other strong measures to support activity in a period of depressed world prices. Close cooperation with the producing provinces and the energy industry is a foremost objective of my Ministers as efforts continue to sustain Canada's energy prospects through this difficult period. These efforts are consistent with the true meaning and spirit of national unity.
Despite current difficulties, encouraging progress has been made towards renewing and strengthening the national economy. Unemployment is at its lowest level in over four years. Average incomes of Canadian families rose in real terms in 1985 for the first time in five years. The federal deficit has declined for the first time in six years. The prime rate is the lowest it has been in eight years. And government program spending has significantly declined for the first time in forty years. These economic indicators are encouraging.
Our efforts are meeting with encouraging success. The challenge now is to forge ahead. My government will do so by remaining true to the course set in the past two years. My government will continue its policy of prudent fiscal and financial management and will seek practical ways to encourage self-reliance and provide individual Canadians the incentive and opportunity to achieve greater security and well-being for themselves and for their families.
National Reconciliation
My government's commitment to national reconciliation invites all Canadians to participate fully and actively in the development of their country.
The Canadian Charter of Rights and the Constitution remain incomplete without the assent of Quebec. My Ministers have begun consultations with the provinces on this important subject. Should there appear reasonable prospects for agreement, formal negotiations will proceed in the expectation that Quebec will take its rightful place as a full partner in the Canadian Constitution.
The question of aboriginal rights is still on the constitutional agenda as a result of the Accord signed with the provinces in 1983. Pursuant to that agreement, a First Ministers Conference on aboriginal constitutional affairs will be convened. This will be the third and last such conference provided for in the 1983 Accord. In cooperation with the provinces, my government will exert every possible effort to bring these discussions to a successful conclusion.
Official bilingualism is an indispensable feature of our national character. Seventeen years after its enactment, Canada's Official Languages Act now needs to be revised. Appropriate legislation will be introduced in this Session to ensure, as well, that this Act conforms with the Canadian Charter of Rights.
My Ministers will propose amendments concerning the objectives and powers of the National Capital Commission. It is their intent to give greater expression and meaning to our national symbols.
Canada's National Parks represent a heritage of great importance to the present and future generations. My government will ask Parliament to approve major reforms to the National Parks Act for the first time since the original Act was passed, over five decades ago.
The preservation of historic properties is important to fostering a sense of history and national identity among Canadians. The government of Canada, as the largest owner of heritage sites and properties in the country, will assume a leadership role in their restoration and preservation.
Economic Renewal
Canada's program of economic renewal has as its goal the building of a national economy equipped to compete in an environment of intense global competition, changing markets, and new technologies. Economic renewal will be furthered by continued progress in restoring health to our public finances, by trade initiatives and by tax reform.
My government has committed itself to four principles in its quest to restore fiscal health to Canada. First, to reduce the growth in the national debt to less than the growth in the economy by the end of this decade. Second, to achieve continuing, sizeable, year-over-year reductions in the deficit. Third, to ensure substantial annual declines in the government's financial requirements. And fourth, to ensure that the greater part of this progress is secured through effective expenditure restraint.
Success in this quest will foster a climate of investor and consumer confidence that will continue to support lower inflation, lower interest rates, higher growth and more job opportunities for Canadians.
If Canada is to achieve an enduring economic recovery, government must also ensure that our country's interests are secured and enhanced in the international sphere.
Nearly one third of our economy depends on international markets. Our future is trade. That is why my government is seeking to open and secure new markets for Canada everywhere in the world. These efforts include bilateral talks with the United States and multilateral negotiations under the auspices of the GATT.
My government intends to improve Canada's status as a trading nation among our major partners. Particular emphasis will be placed upon trade with Japan and other Pacific Rim countries.
Trade promotion, however vigorous, cannot succeed if world markets important to Canadian exporters are threatened by increased protectionism.
Such pressures emphasize the importance of my government's pursuit of a mutually advantageous trade agreement with the United States. These talks are being accompanied by extensive consultations with the provinces, business and labour. Successful negotiations will strengthen both our economy and our capacity to reinforce our culture, our sovereignty, our commitment to regional development and the fundamental purposes of Canadian social policy.
Progress has already been made towards my government's objective of comprehensive tax reform. We have begun to restructure the corporate tax system. Equity in the personal income field has been enhanced through the introduction of the minimum tax. A refundable Sales Tax Credit has been introduced. Opportunities for tax avoidance have been curtailed.
In my government's further consideration of tax reform, fairness will be a guiding principle. The objectives of reform will be to lower tax rates and to
reduce reliance upon personal income tax by improving the revenue balance between personal income and other taxes. A simpler and more comprehensible tax system would also be welcomed by all Canadians.
During this session, you will be asked to consider new initiatives to strengthen the competitiveness of the private sector.
To help remove obstacles to economic growth, my Ministers will continue to reduce the burden of paperwork and regulation, to advance the process of privatization of Crown Corporations, and to press for the removal of barriers to interprovincial trade.
My Ministers will introduce programs to promote small business and entrepreneurial values. Included will be measures to improve procurement procedures, to strengthen the unsolicited proposals program for small companies and entrepreneurs, to increase technology transfer from government laboratories, and to develop new initiatives to promote entrepreneurship among youth.
My government will again be placing before Parliament measures to give Canadians a more efficient, competitive and safe transport system by relieving the burden of unnecessary regulations on the transportation sector.
My government will propose a new regulatory framework for the financial services industry that will promote competition, efficiency, and international competitiveness, while strengthening consumer protection.
For many years, successive governments have sought to provide measures intended to promote regional development. Their efforts have not been as effective as hoped. Regional disparity remains an unacceptable reality of Canadian life. Our experience has shown that spending more money, by itself, has not solved the problem.
It is time to consider new approaches, to examine how our considerable and growing support for Canada's regions can be used more efficiently, more effectively and with greater sensitivity to local conditions and opportunities. In renewing their efforts to come to grips with this longstanding problem, my Ministers are convinced many positive proposals for new policy initiatives will come from those who live and work in the regions concerned.
Building on the human and natural resource strengths of the regions, a renewed cooperative effort will lead to a new development agenda. Special emphasis will be given to diversifying the economic base of Western Canada.
As a first step in achieving improved results from this sustained national approach, an Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency will be constituted to facilitate and coordinate all federal development initiatives in the area. This agency will make fuller use of the expertise available in the Atlantic region and invite the maximum participation of other governments and organizations in the area.
My government is concerned about the increasing concentration of corporations, particularly where takeovers serve to increase corporate size without creating new jobs or stimulating economic growth in Canada. Some aspects of this essentially non-productive activity will be examined and considered by Members of this House.
The importance of the fishing industry to Canada is fundamental. To provide increased safety for our fishermen and to protect their material investments, my government will place special emphasis on improving the management of small craft harbours in all fishing areas.
The forest sector is Canada's largest net export earner. My Ministers have substantially increased funding for forestry renewal. The government will continue to work in close partnership with the provinces, industry, and private woodlot owners to ensure that Canada's rich forest heritage continues as a vital source of wealth and jobs for future generations.
Measures will be introduced to strengthen Canada's cooperatives and to give recognition to their role in community development.
My government is deeply committed to supporting, with the provinces, a system of post-secondary education based on excellence and equality of opportunity. To help meet the challenges facing higher education, my government will propose a national forum on post-secondary education, to be held early next year.
My Ministers have begun to forge a partnership with the provinces, with the scientific and educational communities, and with business and labour in an effort to stimulate increased technological development in Canada. To assist and encourage cooperation between the universities and private sector in research and development, my government has announced an initiative that could provide a billion dollars in new funding for scientific research over the next five years.
My government will build upon this partnership by introducing a new four-point program to ensure that support for science, technology and education is more clearly focused in the national interest.
First, my government will appoint a National Advisory Board for Industrial Technology, chaired by the Prime Minister and composed of some of Canada's leading industrialists and scientists. This committee will assess national science and technology goals and policies, and their application to Canada's economy. Second, in full cooperation with the provinces, my government will seek to achieve high standards of excellence in education, technology development, and innovation. Third, it will introduce a new Federal Science and Technology Strategy, building on the initiatives undertaken to date. The strategy will introduce the necessary reforms within the federal administration to encourage Canada's international competitiveness. Fourth, my government will convene a National Conference on Technology and Innovation to assist Canada to define new technology goals.
My government's commitment to high technology as a motive force in Canada's economic growth will be expressed in legislation to establish a Canadian space agency. International cooperation in the peaceful use of space is essential to the development of key technologies. Working in cooperation with industry, universities and provinces, the new agency will help to ensure that the benefits of Canada's role in space will be shared by all Canadians.
Constructive Internationalism
The people of Canada maintain a deep interest in their country's role in the world. As Honourable Members of the Special Joint Committee of this Parliament know, Canadians seek a confident, constructive, active internationalism that reflects our hopes for the world as well as our own vital national interests.
From my own travels, and those of my Ministers, I can attest that other countries, large and small, look to Canada to play a vital role in the international community. Over the past year, I have travelled to Italy and the Vatican, while the Prime Minister has represented my government at the Commonwealth Conference, at the 40th Anniversary of the United Nations, the Francophone Summit, the Tokyo Summit, and in visits to France, Japan, China, South Korea, and the United States.
Our support for the multilateral institutions and agencies of which we are members remains the cornerstone of our foreign policy.
With Her Majesty the Queen as its head and unifying presence, the Commonwealth brings together countries of the North and South in support of common ideals and aspirations. The Commonwealth is central to Canada's efforts to promote, through concerted international action, a process of political dialogue in South Africa aimed at establishing representative government. My government will continue this effort, through the Commonwealth and the United Nations, until apartheid is abolished.
The world is aware how spontaneously the Canadian people rallied to the challenge of African famine and relief, demonstrating a concern and compassion so much a part of the national character. As Canadians, we will be called upon to respond to other challenges in the Third World. In reaffirming our commitments, it will be our purpose to find new partners in the ongoing efforts to pursue opportunities for increased development.
No task is more important to Canadians than preserving world peace and security. My government is encouraged by the prospects for renewed dialogue between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union. We share the hope of other nations of the world that progress towards these talks will be sustained and appreciable.
Arms control and disarmament are essential elements of Canadian policy. We are in the forefront of multilateral discussions concerning conventional arms control and confidence-building in Europe. In the nuclear field, both the verification of existing agreements and the conclusion of new accords are vital elements in Canada's efforts. As a further step towards these objectives, my government will host this month an international symposium that will explore means of improving verification techniques.
My government recognizes that security is the surest safeguard of liberty. Accordingly, my government has taken steps to modernize and renew the
Speech from the Throne
strength of our Armed Forces and increase our NATO contingent in Western Europe.
The Government asserts complete sovereignty over the Canadian Arctic and recognizes that sovereignty requires a vigorous national presence. My government has drawn straight baselines around the perimeter of the Arctic archipelago to preserve Canadian sovereignty over the land, sea, and ice of the Canadian Arctic. Canada will construct one of the most powerful icebreakers in the world to enhance our sovereign rights and to contribute to the development of the North.
Other measures have been taken or will be initiated to support this vital national purpose, including more research on polar conditions, defence training exercises in the Arctic, and the establishment of a National Park at Ellesmere Island.
Social Justice
A dynamic and changing society poses new challenges for social policy. Existing programs are not always wholly successful in meeting their objectives. They must be reviewed to ensure they are appropriate to today's circumstances and they must be strengthened where necessary. At the same time, new circumstances require the development of new programs.
My Ministers are well aware that social policy concerns are more satisfactorily met in a strong and growing economy that, in turn, requires steady progress in restoring fiscal health to our nation's finances. But fiscal responsibility is fully compatible with social responsibility.
My government will continue to enlist the support of all in pursuit of the common goal: a modern, tolerant, and caring nation in which its citizens are secure and prosperous.
Canadians would want their governments to give the highest priority in social policy to those who are in greatest need. As well, Canadians expect to enjoy the highest quality in health care and other social benefits that have become fundamental to our national quality of life.
My government is resolved to defend and strengthen the institution of the Canadian family.
Only now is our society beginning its effort to adjust to the evolving changes in family relationships and responsibilities, particularly concerning working parents. My government recognizes that adequate, quality child care must become available. Following the report of your committee, my government will initiate discussions with the provinces, business and labour with a view to implementing a concerted approach to child care.
As a national priority, we must continue to remove the barriers that have prevented women from participating freely and equitably in the mainstream of Canadian society. My government regards the recent significant increase in appointments of women to the highest levels of the public service and to federal boards and commissions as only a first step towards full equality. My Ministers hope and expect the private sector will regard this progress as an example to follow. In its desire to further the advancement of women in government, my Ministers will continue their efforts to correct inequitable wage rates in the public service.
My government will take effective action against child sexual abuse, violent forms of pornography involving women and children, child prostitution, and the grave and growing threat posed by the traffic in illegal drugs.
A national drug strategy and a comprehensive program dealing with impaired drivers will be brought forward to support the prevention of drug and alcohol abuse. My government will continue to provide domestic and international leadership in controlling drug abuse in amateur sport.
Reforms to the Criminal Code will be continued during this session of Parliament, reflecting the importance Canadians attach to such values as respect for the law and the protection of innocent citizens.
Measures will also be put before you designed to protect and assist victims of criminal violence. Further action will be proposed to assist in finding missing children.
Canadians are becoming increasingly aware of the suffering of battered women. This intolerable affront to human dignity and personal security compels my government's commitment to work with the provinces to implement on an urgent basis the most effective means and methods of action.
After a decade of debate, an historic agreement with the provinces has been reached that will improve benefits under the Canada Pension Plan, beginning on January 1, 1987. It will also put the plan on a sound financial footing for the future.
The federal Pension Benefits Standards Act, which sets standards that employer-sponsored pension plans must meet, has also been completely revised. The changes introduced will be of fundamental significance for wage earners, especially women in the labour force, and for the spouses of pension plan members.
The introduction of the new Canadian Jobs Strategy, which for the first time sets targets for women's participation, has helped women, particularly immigrant women, and the unemployed in their search for lasting and productive employment.
My government is encouraged by the decline in youth unemployment. However, much remains to be done. My Ministers are committed to federal-provincial and private sector cooperative action that will enhance job opportunities and encourage greater participation and involvement of young Canadians in productive and challenging initiatives.
Canadians recognize the courage and talent of our disabled citizens. Inspired by the example of Rick Hansen, we are made more aware of the potential for new directions and initiatives to aid the disabled.
My government will work with the provinces, the private sector and voluntary organizations to develop measures to ensure that Canadians have access to the literacy skills that are the prerequisites for participation in an advanced economy.
Ongoing improvements have also been made in assuring greater income security for the elderly. All widows and widowers aged 60 to 64 are now eligible to receive Spouses' Allowance Benefits. A new program of Older Worker Adjustment is also being negotiated with the provinces. The Government will introduce legislation to increase tax assistance for retirement savings through Registered Retirement Savings Plans. The object will be to make access to tax assistance fairer between employees and the self-employed, and to increase the flexibility of options for the use of Registered Retirement Savings Plan savings by senior citizens.
In a spirit of deep respect and appreciation, my government will continue to address the needs of Canada's veterans. The Veterans Independence Program will be broadened to allow a greater number of First World War veterans to qualify immediately for the benefits designed to enable them to remain independent in their own homes rather than be compelled to accept institutional care. New legislation will also be introduced to streamline the pension process to provide faster, more efficient service to veterans.
In acknowledging the tens of thousands of Canadians who serve their communities and country as volunteers, my Ministers will propose further support to encourage the growth of voluntarism in our society.
Canada's amateur athletes instill pride in our country and achieve excellence in international competition. My government renews its commitment to the increased participation of young Canadian men and women in a wide variety of athletic endeavours, including the 1988 Winter Olympics that Canada will host in Calgary.
It is imperative that Canada's multicultural and multiracial reality be integral to all facets of our national life to reflect the vital and distinctive nature of Canadian society.
To that end, my government will: encourage the entrepreneurial spirit that characterizes our many minority communities and that contributes so essentially to Canada's economic development; extend recognition to minority community organizations in our society and increase equitable participation in appointments to federal boards and agencies; and affirm that any existing remnants of institutional barriers that limit opportunities for visible minorities or other groups or individuals are dismantled.
My government will continue to assert a positive leadership role in opposing racism and discrimination, in whatever form. It will continue to resist injustices imposed upon any ethnic, religious, or racial group in the knowledge that to do otherwise would diminish this nation's profound commitment to universal tolerance and human dignity.
Honourable Members: you will be asked to consider amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act, which will represent further progress in the long march of this nation towards full equality.
My government will propose comprehensive legislation designed to simplify and improve Canada's refugee determination process. These reforms will produce a system which is both fair and effective. It will assist genuine refugees in need of protection and discourage abuse of Canada's humanitarian tradition.
My government recognizes fully the essential relationship between a healthy environment and the quality of Canadian life. A new Environmental Protection Act will be introduced to improve my government's capacity, in concert with the provinces, to deal effectively with pollution, focusing on toxic chemicals. You will also be asked to consider measures to improve water quality in Canada and to safeguard citizens from the hazards of chemicals in our society.
My government remains determined to pursue with the United States the rapid implementation of the recommendations of our Special Envoys with respect to acid rain.
Following the recommendations of an industry-labour-government task force, my government will propose legislation to establish a Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System.
My government has begun to renew our economy and society for the benefit of all Canadians. It has acted to strengthen our national sovereignty and to affirm our independence. But there remains much more to be done.
Each generation of Canadians has risen to the challenges of nation-building. Today's generation confronts its own challenges: we must act now to ensure that the ties which bind us together as Canadians remain strong, in our national cultural institutions, in our sense of community and in our pride as a nation.
Whether through railways in the last century, or broadcasting in this century, Canadians have responded to the task of building one nation across a massive continent. Throughout our history, Canadians have acquired credentials as peacekeepers, as entrepreneurs, as innovators.
Today the new challenge is to assert our interests in a world that is intimate, competitive, and driven by rapid technological change.
Your challenge, in this Parliament, is to apply those Canadian qualities with the same vision and the same commitment that created a nation from a wilderness. The new challenge is to open up new horizons for Canadians-those to be reached through knowledge and information.
In this new environment, we must ensure that all Canadians can pursue their own dreams and expand their own opportunities through greater use of information and knowledge about one another and the world beyond.
To begin debate on this fundamental challenge, my government will define its objectives and ways to achieve them.
It will be essential to ensure that the ideas and information which flow through a modern national communications system reflect the distinct cultural values of the Canadian people. For this reason, the government will act to strengthen the Canadian broadcasting system and renew our commitment to Canadian cultural values.
To a considerable degree, our sense of national purpose, our national identity, and our economic prosperity will depend on our capacity to respond to the opportunities which flow from this new information age.
Our dual linguistic heritage and unique history situate Canada within two great communities of nations, the Commonwealth and la Francophonie. Canada is thus positioned to reaffirm its role in the world by developing joint projects with member countries of these two vast families of nations, to share with them Canadian communications and information technologies while bringing to Canadians a greater diversity of ideas and cultural expressions.
By so doing, Canada will renew in innovative ways its commitment to an established institution, the Commonwealth, and contribute actively to the emergence of a new one, la Francophonie.
The great tasks to which you are committed in this Parliament are national in character. The important reforms you will have considered and adopted give to each the opportunity to make a valued, individual contribution to the legislative process.
Your deliberations must address the aspirations of all Canadians and reflect their pride and confidence in the enduring strengths of the political institutions
they believe to be the guarantors of freedom and security, and the guardians of the nation's future.
My government shares the expectations of all Canadians that public office holders maintain the highest standards of conduct, especially in the area of conflict of interest. It will be considering proposals which reflect the essential considerations of fairness to the office holder and the protection of the public's interest.
Members of the House of Commons:
I think with pleasure of the determination you will display as you embark on the program of work prepared by my government, and of the good use you will make of your skill and experience. I shall follow your debates with interest. I am assured that this new session will mark a further stage in the growth and flowering of our life as a nation.
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to consider legislation to advance the economic, social and international interests of Canadians.
In pursuit of these worthy objectives, may Divine Providence guide your efforts."
33,34,1,1988-12-12,conservative,"Ladies and gentlemen, Honourable Members of the Senate,
Ladies and gentlemen, Members of the House of Commons:
It is my great pleasure to greet you on this, the first day of the Thirty-fourth Parliament since Confederation. This ceremony is rich in history, custom, tradition and symbolism. It is also a renewal of the vital relationship among Crown, people, parliament and government that, today as in the past, is the essence of Canadian democracy.
The people have spoken in a general election three weeks ago. Their members in the House of Commons have today claimed from the Crown the ancient rights and privileges that enable them to carry out their responsibilities.
In the election, my government sought and received a mandate for its policies, including the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the United States that is to take effect on January 1, 1989. The purpose of this early session of the Thirty-fourth Parliament is to seek your approval for legislation to implement this Agreement as scheduled. Similar legislation was passed by the House of Commons in August. It had also received approval in principle in the Senate and had reached the stage of Senate committee study, prior to dissolution of the Thirty-third Parliament.
My government is determined to secure the benefits of economic opportunity for this and future generations of Canadians. This Agreement reflects my ministers' confidence in Canada's ability to compete with the best in the world.
In due course, we will hold a second session of the Parliament, at which time my ministers will place before you a statement of policy for this, their second mandate in office. Meanwhile, you may be asked at the present session to consider other matters as deemed advisable by my government.
Ladies and gentlemen, Honourable Members of the Senate,
Ladies and gentlemen, Members of the House of Commons:
As you carry out the will of the people and serve the national interest, may Divine Providence be your guide and inspiration."
34,34,2,1989-04-04,conservative,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Honourable Members of the Senate,
Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the House of Commons:
It is indeed a pleasure to greet you as you resume your duties.
Today, at the outset of this Second Session of Canada's Thirty-fourth Parliament, my government will put forward the objectives and purposes which it will pursue during its second mandate.
My government believes these objectives to be fundamental:
First, to build a strong economy, encouraged by incentive and opportunity, an economy fully competitive among the world's trading nations and one in which all Canadians may share its challenges, risks and rewards;
Second, to preserve Canada's environment, to actively encourage increased public interest and involvement, and to give firm leadership and support to international efforts to overcome the environmental threat to our planet;
Third, to maintain a caring, compassionate society which will be able, through continuing economic prosperity, to meet its obligations and responsibilities to those who are less fortunate and in greatest need; and
Fourth, to foster a confident sense of Canada's cultural and national uniqueness in which Canadians may have a greater sense of their common values and common citizenship.
Finally, as my government renews its commitment to national unity, it believes the ratification of the Meech Lake Accord is indispensable to the further evolution of the Canadian constitution.
With Quebec at the table as a willing participant, future constitutional development-including the important issues of Senate reform, of aboriginal and linguistic rights, of roles and responsibilities in relation to fisheries, and of ways to strengthen the Charter of Rights and Freedoms-will become possible and will be a priority of the government.
A Strong Economy
Since 1984, federal spending on programs has grown less rapidly than inflation and at less than one-third the average rate of the previous four years. In the last four years, the annual government deficit has declined from over eight percent to less than five percent of gross domestic product. This represents a decline, in absolute terms, of close to ten billion dollars. Over the same period of time, Canadians have enjoyed extraordinarily strong income growth and job creation. Indeed, Canada's economic performance has outpaced virtually all of the world's major industrialized nations.
Today our challenge is to maintain that expansion in a world economic environment that is increasingly subject to inflationary pressures. To meet this challenge and to enjoy the benefits of continued growth and prosperity will require the utmost resolve of the government and the Canadian people.
My government will soon introduce a budget reflecting that resolve.
My ministers believe that continued progress in reducing the deficit is a vital necessity if Canada's economic well-being is to be secured. The legacy of past deficits is a massive debt. Annual interest payments on that debt now consume 31 cents of every dollar of government revenue. These payments are putting pressure on the Government's ability to meet other priorities. In fact, Canada is now borrowing money solely to pay the interest on previous borrowings. In order to reverse this trend, expenditures must be reduced and revenues must cover the cost of government programs.
My government's budget will have as its purpose the continuation of the nation's prosperity.
The strength of the Canadian economy can be ensured only if the government's means and its spending are in better balance. In turn, an
expanding economy is the only way to maintain the social programs which Canadians cherish. Only by positive measures designed to reduce the burden of the debt can Canadians avoid a repetition of the excessive unemployment and inflation rates of the early 1980s.
My government is convinced that the Canadian people will endorse our efforts to control federal spending in order to maintain economic stability and continued growth.
Thx reform is also critical to sustain the prosperity that is so vitally necessary to ensure the high standards of services Canadians expect from their government. The current federal sales tax is inefficient and inequitable. It is costing Canadians jobs.
It will be replaced with a fairer sales tax that will ensure the Canadian economy is fully competitive and that will maintain a stable source of revenues to finance essential programs. Extensive consultations have been undertaken by my government both with the provinces and the private sector. These consultations will help ensure that sales tax reform is implemented in a fair and effective way.
Preparing Canada's Future
Canadians have made it evident that they are confident of their abilities to compete successfully in the international economy of a widening world.
As a mature and confident people, they know Canada's economy cannot prosper behind tariff walls and in restricted markets. They prefer to support the cause of liberalized trade throughout the world. My government is continuing the process of implementing the Free Hade Agreement with Canada's principal trading partner, the United States. Multilateral trade negotiations through the Uruguay round of GATT are also a high priority. As well, the federal government will continue to work with provincial governments in reducing interprovincial trade barriers which create distortions and inequities in Canada's economic development.
Outward-looking trade policies will be necessary for Canada if it is to be competitive in the world. Many industrialized countries-notably in Western Europe-are forming larger trading alliances so that their industries may benefit from access to larger markets. Business firms are creating world-scale plants as a means of realizing the opportunities which flow from liberalized trade.
With the development of cost-efficient manufacturing in the newly industrialized economies of Asia-and more competitive resource development in the Third World - major new factors are emerging in the international market place. No nation can remain indifferent to, or aloof from, these economic realities.
Canadians in every occupation want to ensure a secure future for themselves and their families in the face of these rapidly emerging economic forces. While they recognize the challenge which confronts them, Canadians also have a confident view of the opportunities which await them.
My government is providing programs to assist small and mediumsized business to develop export opportunities that are emerging as a result of the Free Trade Agreement. The federal government is also placing greater emphasis on the Asia/Pacific region as well as on Europe.
My government's purpose is to ensure that the benefits of liberalized trade and economic expansion are shared fairly by all Canadians.
The National Advisory Board on Science and Technology, composed of members from the scientific and technical communities from all parts of the country, has established a continuing dialogue between Canada's scientific leadership and the federal government. The Board has made a number of important policy recommendations. These include a network of centres of excellence and programs for the development of strategic technologies such as biotechnology, advanced industrial materials, and information technology. These recommendations are now being acted upon, and my government will provide direction and leadership in this vital area of Canada's national life.
The new federal approach to regional development is working. Decentralized decision making, through the regional agencies in Western Canada, Northern Ontario, and Atlantic Canada, has been instrumental in stimulating both entrepreneurial endeavor and business investment. Funding for regional development in Quebec and for these agencies will be continued, and government procurement policies will become increasingly responsive to regional considerations.
My government is concerned that our native peoples participate fully in Canada's economic development prospects and, to this end, will be extending its programs to assist native economic development.
The government will continue other economic initiatives of its first mandate, including:
further privatization of those Crown corporations which no longer serve a public policy role; and
passage of business framework legislation which will contribute to the smooth functioning of a modern economy, including the reform of laws dealing with bankruptcy and the regulation of financial institutions.
These initiatives will serve to build a modern, competitive, market-oriented economy.
Jobs for Canadians
Greater competition in our largest trading markets, a diminishing reliance on traditional industries, the rapid growth of the service sector and more sophisticated technology -all these indicate the need for a comprehensive human resource strategy for the 1990s.
If Canada is to meet these new standards and compete in this changing world situation, it must rely upon the skills and resourcefulness of the Canadian people. It must make full participants of disabled persons and visible minorities. It is imperative that literacy initiatives, education, training and retraining for Canada's work force, especially our youth, reflect the requirements of a modern economy.
Expanded labour-force programs to encourage continual upgrading of skills will be an important focus of my government's response to the report of the Advisory Council on Adjustment. Extensive discussions will
be initiated with labour, industry, the provinces and other interested parties in order to encourage their participation in this vital process.
My government will propose amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Program in order to improve the Program's effectiveness and its fairness. These changes will direct more resources toward active training which, together with improved identification of marketable job skills, will promote greater opportunities and a more productive and rewarding experience in the work force.
At the same time, this program will continue to recognize the special circumstances in regions with historically high levels of unemployment.
It is also my government's intention to restructure unemployment insurance benefits in order to eliminate inconsistencies with Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, to create greater incentives to employment, and to ensure that the resources available are used more effectively to generate greater labour market opportunities.
The increasing participation of women in the work force underlines the need for initiatives that promote equality of opportunity in Canada's economic life. The report of the Thsk Force on Barriers to the Employment and Promotion of Women in the Public Service will give my government-as the largest employer in the country-further opportunity to remove or reduce the difficulties that many women still find impede their working careers.
The Environmental Imperative
Canadians possess a unique sense of their relationship to the land, whose rich, vast diversity has shaped their values and experience.
Throughout the regions and across all linguistic and ethnic communities, there is a shared concern that we protect our environment for generations of future Canadians.
The world itself is facing an environmental challenge of unprecedented magnitude. Recognizing this, my government has strongly supported the Brundtland World Commission on Environment and Development and its call for ""sustainable development""-which holds that the state of the world's environment, the strength of the global economy and the health of the earth's inhabitants are inextricably linked.
My government will participate in the establishment of a centre for the international promotion of sustainable development, to be located in Winnipeg.
As well, the National Round Thble on the Environment and the Economy has been established to provide leadership and to form new partnerships of effort among Canadians, in order to deal more effectively with environmental concerns and their relationship to the challenges of economic growth. The government has also altered its operational practices and enlarged the responsibilities of the Minister of the Environment to ensure that environmental issues are fully considered in the course of its decision making.
These initiatives are part of a new environmental agenda which will also include the commitment to:
limit the environmental impact of toxic chemicals through the development of regulations for the Canadian Environmental Protection Act;
improve the quality of our water, through new legislation;
protect the environmental integrity of our arctic regions; and
improve the quality of the atmosphere through the negotiation of an acid rain accord with the United States, the implementation of the Ozone Protocol signed in Montreal in 1987, and the pursuit of further international efforts to control toxic emissions and to stimulate the evolution of international institutions in environmental matters.
In order to promote the restoration and enhancement of the environment, my government will proceed with initiatives to clean up the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River and, together with the provinces, to further the process of cleaning up dangerous land sites.
Furthermore, my government will continue to encourage the expansion of Canada's environmental industry and, through sound scientific research, will continue to encourage the development and adoption of clean and efficient production processes. Technology, services, and environmentally friendly products are the key components of this industry. And the opportunities for domestic application and international export of equipment, knowledge and goods are considerable.
Individual Canadians will be encouraged to become more aware of environmental matters with the establishment of the Environmental Partners Fund. This fund will assist them in actively enhancing their environment by initiatives promoting the production and consumption of environmentally sound products, and with programs to encourage recycling.
Legislation will also be introduced to ensure an appropriate environmental assessment review process.
A Caring Nation
Canada's social policies touch the lives of all Canadians. These programs and services give shape and substance to the special quality of Canadian life. And they reflect the distinctive values that give to the Canadian people their sense of uniqueness.
In responding to future challenges and needs, Canada's social goals and programs will continue to be determined in Canada and by Canadians, in conformity and harmony with values they have historically nurtured.
My government believes fundamentally in those social benefits which support the family and the elderly, while recognizing the need to direct more assistance toward those with low incomes.
The government remains committed to a national child care program.
My government will continue its initiatives to reduce violence in the family and the abuse of children. It will renew its fight against AIDS and drug abuse. It will encourage research into diseases associated with aging, so destructive of human dignity and family life.
My government will introduce further legislation to reform Canada's legal system and sentencing practices. This will require a review of the current Young Offenders Act in order to ensure that it better protects the rights of society, while advancing the rehabilitation of young offenders.
My government is considering the implications of the latest jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada on the subject of abortion, so as to carefully weigh the appropriate course of action in relation to this sensitive matter.
Advances in medical and biological science have created in Canada, as in other countries, a variety of new reproductive technologies: artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, embryo transfer and surrogate parenting. There is concern that these scientific advances will outpace our ability to deal with their moral, ethical, legal and social implications. My government will therefore mandate a royal commission to inquire into the implications of new reproductive technologies for Canadian society.
Canada's International Role
Canadians are, by vocation, world citizens. They helped form the United Nations, and are among its most creative and consistent supporters. Forty years ago this week, Canada played a pivotal role in the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Canada retains that active commitment to freedom and to Europe. Canada is active in the Commonwealth, la Francophonie, the Economic Summit, GATT, and in other initiatives to improve the standards and security of the international community.
Canadians prize freedom and tolerance at home, and pursue those values in the world.
My government will continue to take a strong stand in defence of human rights. It will continue to be among the leaders in peacekeeping, in international development, in strengthening international organizations, and in relieving the devastation of famine or of natural disaster. It will apply firmly and fairly the new legislation on refugees, and will expand overall immigration levels.
We are a northern nation, proud of our arctic frontier, and determined to work with our northern allies and neighbours to develop a new cooperative ethic in the Arctic.
Canada is the immediate neighbour of both superpowers, and my government will apply Canada's influence to increase understanding and co-operation between East and West. The government will continue its support of progress toward the reduction and control of arms, and will continue to help resolve regional disputes.
Modern economic, social and environmental realities draw the world together dramatically. In these new circumstances, Canada has special contributions to make, and legitimate interests to advance and defend.
Canada's efficient agricultural producers cannot compete fairly in a world in which trade-distorting subsidies wreak havoc with market disciplines, while bringing undue pressure to bear on the nation's treasury.
Canadians who fish for a living find their catches reduced by predatory over-fishing outside the 200-mile limit, where Canadian regulations cannot be enforced. My government will intensify its international efforts to put an end to these practices.
Canada s National Identity
Canadians define who they are-as a people-by what they have done.
Today, Canada stands as one of the most dynamic, peaceful and promising nations in the world. This has been achieved by a people who have placed the highest priority on the need for tolerance, compassion and fairness. Canadian society cares about the quality of its national life, its health, education, human welfare and environment. Canadian values, formed and developed by Canadians, have produced a unique national identity of which Canadians are justifiably proud.
This has been the exceptional achievement of little more than a century of history. The people of Canada, therefore, have cause for
celebration. My government has invited the participation of all the provinces and territories in planning Canada's 125th birthday in 1992.
The same year will mark the 350th anniversary of the founding of Montreal.
Canadians are justifiably proud of their cultural industries- distinctive, creative and increasingly recognized worldwide. My government will continue its commitment to the growth and development of Canada's cultural life, to this nation's linguistic duality, and to its rich and diverse multicultural heritage. It will improve the distribution of Canada's cultural products in broadcasting, film and video. It will propose legislation to further improve the laws on copyright.
My government will introduce a revitalized citizenship act. Legislation will be introduced to establish a Canadian race relations foundation. By this initiative, my government intends to emphasize the need for all Canadians to support and encourage racial harmony.
The state and condition of Canada's political institutions, which represent the bulwark of our democracy, require constant interest and concern. My government will build upon the recent achievements in the field of parliamentary reform. You will be asked to legislate new conflict-of-interest standards for parliamentarians.
My government will appoint a commission of inquiry to make recommendations for needed changes and reforms to the electoral laws.
Conclusion
During the remaining years leading to the 21st century, challenge and opportunity alike will become a familiar part of the daily life of the people of Canada. The challenge will be to the nation's strength of purpose, to its will to persist and to prosper, to its resolve to be worthy of its special heritage and history, and to its determination to promote economic development in a manner consistent with a safe and wholesome environment.
As a strong, skilled and confident people, Canadians will find a greater place in world commerce and trade, in technological innovation, and in scientific development and discovery. The first task for my ministers will be to help prepare the way for this viable and dynamic Canada.
My government's priorities are firm, and its determination to pursue the plan started four years ago is unflinching. My government's task is to be ready for the challenges ahead as Canadians move toward a new century.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Honourable Members of the Senate,
Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence guide your deliberations."
35,34,3,1991-05-13,conservative,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Honourable Members of the Senate,
Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the House of Commons.
It is my great pleasure to greet you as you begin the third session of the Thirty- Fourth Parliament.
In the past fifteen months, my wife and I have had the wonderful privilege of meeting thousands of Canadians at Rideau Hall, La Citadelle and in our visits to all of Canada's provinces and territories.
Whatever our background and wherever we live, Canadians share the same basic hopes and aspirations. We are proud of the great country we have inherited. Above all, we are determined to leave it a better and stronger place for our children.
As Gerda and I meet Canadians, we are moved by the special regard they have for the Queen and for the role she has played in our history. In the nearly forty years since she ascended the throne, she has been served by all seven Canadian Governors General-and she remains a living example of the continuity and stability that are fundamental to our system of government.
Therefore, it was a genuine pleasure this year, on your behalf, to congratulate Her Majesty and wish her well on the occasion of her 65th birthday.
This session will be a turning point in Canadian history. Let no one doubt the seriousness of the challenges we face as a country. You will have the responsibility and the opportunity to forge an historic accommodation that embraces all Canadians, overcomes division and discord and charts a course for prosperity for generations to come.
Last July 1st, when Her Majesty came to celebrate Canada Day with us, she said that the unity of the Canadian people is the paramount issue we face, just as it was at the time of Confederation. And, she went on, ``There is no force, except the force of will, to keep Canadians together.'' I believe that Canadians have that will.
I am confident that, as long as we adhere to the values on which this country was founded-belief in human dignity, respect for differences, civility in our dealings with each other-we cannot fail.
Canada's history is the history of builders and achievers. Together, Canadian men and women have created a society that is as free and fair as any on earth; ours is one of the oldest functioning democracies, a beacon of freedom to people everywhere. Around the world, Canada is respected for the constructive role we play in global affairs, for the protection we accord human rights, for our tolerance of diversity, for our environmental sensitivity, and for our cultural accomplishments.
Canada is also envied for our economic prosperity; we rank only thirty-first in population but we have built the world's eighth largest economy. That economic strength allows us to maintain some of the most advanced social programs in the world.
Millions of people around the world would gladly give up everything they have for the privilege of living in Canada.That is a reality and a response to those who would question the value of Canadian citizenship.
Canada will celebrate its 125th birthday during this session. Let us ensure this celebration will be looked back upon as a milestone on the road to a united and prosperous future. Let us mark the occasion with the same spirit of confidence and the sense of accomplishment with which we all commemorated Canada's Centennial and Expo 67. We believed then that the potential of Canada was unparalleled. It remains so now.
To realize our great promise, we must rebuild Canadian unity and overcome the acrimony, apathy and incomprehension that currently undermine it. In light of the global economic revolution of the past quarter century, we must make the reforms necessary to earn the prosperity that until recently seemed our birthright. And we must address urgently the doubts that have been expressed about the capability of our institutions and processes to achieve these goals.
Proposals will be put before you, therefore, that address these three major concerns of the Canadian people and of my government-unity, prosperity and government responsiveness. I am confident that the importance of these issues will persuade all Parliamentarians to put Canada first, set partisan motives and calculations aside and work together for a stronger country.
Canadian Unity
We have been confided the stewardship of this great nation, constructed across an entire continent by generations of men and women determined to make a home for themselves and a future for heir children. They were inspired in their sacrifice by the conviction that tolerance and fairness, courage and compassion, and individual enterprise and neighbourly cooperation could overcome all obstacles and erase all doubts.
Now it is the turn of our generation to overcome obstacles, erase doubts and strengthen Canada to meet the challenges of the 21st century. In doing so, we must safeguard the rights of all Canadians and maintain those standards of citizenship that distinguish the Canadian way of life. Some reforms can be achieved through legislation or policy; others require changes to our attitudes; and still others require changes to our constitution.
A constitution should unite a nation. Canadians across this country should be able to see themselves and their hopes and aspirations mirrored in their constitution. It is the one document that all Canadians should refer to with pride. That is not presently the case in Canada. And no task is more important than making the constitution a more faithful reflection of who we are, what we represent as a country and what we aspire to be as a people.
The Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future was constituted to give Canadians an opportunity to express their hopes and views on the kind of country Canada should be, so we can continue to prosper as we cross the threshold together into a new century. The Special Joint Committee on the Process for Amending the Constitution was established to allow Canadians to be involved in finding a better way of making constitutional changes. Both have increased understanding among Canadians of how much we have in common-as well as awareness of what we stand to lose. Canadians are moving beyond focusing on problems to suggesting solutions.
My government looks forward to receiving the recommendations of the two committees by Canada Day, July 1st. The committee reports, together with the work of similar commissions in several provinces and the soundings you have all taken of the views of your own constituents, will give you the understanding you need of what Canadians want done.
My government will formulate new proposals to focus public discussion on the goal of a more united and prosperous Canada. The proposals will suggest changes in federal and provincial powers and responsibilities and in national institutions. My government will be guided by a number of basic principles:
-that Canada has already proven its worth; we seek change in order to improve Canada, not to discard what we have accomplished together;
-that the Government of Canada represents all Canadianst; and that change can be achieved only through reasonable compromise and enlightened accommodation of the interests of all Canadians;
-that Quebec's unique character must be affirmed and that the particular interests of the West, the Atlantic provinces, Ontario, the North and aboriginal Canadians must be recognized, as well; and
-that the tests of constitutional reform will be fairness, effectiveness, efficiency and the protection afforded to the rights of all Canadians.
In September, my government will refer its proposals to a joint parliamentary committee that will be established to consult with Canadians. The committee will be asked to travel in order to hear the views of men and women across Canada. In each jurisdiction it visits, the committee will be mandated to meet in public session with its counterpart provincial or territorial legislative committee or, where no such committee exists, with counterpart legislators. It will, also, meet with aboriginal groups. The committee will be asked to report back to the government within five months.
After receipt and consideration of the committee's report, my government will propose a plan for a renewed Canada for consideration by the people of Canada. You will be asked to approve enabling legislation to provide for greater participation of Canadian men and women in constitutional change.
My government will work to create a climate in which Canadians can deepen their understanding of their history and traditions and their appreciation of their country's rich diversity. Events planned for 1992, the 125th anniversary of Confederation, will contribute to this greater understanding.
The ability of Canadians to live together in harmony and the ability of Canada to make a major contribution to world affairs depend upon our understanding of who we are as a people. To reduce Canada's vulnerability in an age of rapid, even turbulent, change and of growing interdependence, it is more important than ever that we speak to the world with one, clear and united voice. My government will conduct an active foreign policy in support of the full range of Canadian interests around the world-economic and security, environmental and social. My government will continue to promote democratic values and to defend human rights in the conduct of its foreign and development assistance policies as the best means to ensure progress and stability in a changing world environment and to safeguard Canadian security and prosperity.
Participating in Prosperit
My government will invite Canadians to participate in fashioning a new agenda for prosperity. The goal is to build a prosperous society in which all men and women have an equal opportunity to participate, in which benefits and responsibilities are fairly shared and in which the most vulnerable among us are protected.
There is much more to Canadian unity than amending the constitution. Our unity is strengthened by a strong economy. And prosperity is enhanced by a united country. But disunity in the face of the global economic challenge invites decline.
Economic recovery depends on reducing interest rates. To bring interest rates down, government finances have been put on a sound base. My government is controlling its spending and has established low but achievable inflation targets. That is the way to restore the confidence of Canadians in their future.
Restored confidence means new investment and new investment means meaningful jobs and a better life for all Canadians. With this fiscally disciplined approach, the economy will recover in the second half of this year and will grow strongly in 1992.
Looking to the longer term, Canadians are asking themselves what the future holds for themselves and for their families in a world that is changing so rapidly and profoundly. Deficit reduction, tax reform, free trade and productivity growth are all part of my government's plan to secure the future of Canadians.
Canada is inescapably part of the global economy. As citizens of a country that depends for its prosperity on the sale abroad of almost thirty percent of all it produces, the importance to Canadians of being able to compete effectively in international trade can scarcely be overstated. We guarantee our future, not by running from global competition, but by meeting it head-on, by equipping ourselves to compete with the best, by giving ourselves the economic conditions we need to be competitive and by making world markets accessible to our products.
The Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement has helped to secure the Canadian economy in difficult times. Private, non-residential investment in Canada, as a share of our gross domestic product, has been taking place at record levels. For the first time in sixteen years, Canada has been attracting more direct investment-the key to job creation and job opportunities-has been going abroad.
My government believes North America-wide free trade is a logical next step-and one that would increase the prosperity of all Canadians-if an acceptable agreement can be negotiated with Mexico and the United States. My government will, also, cooperate with Canadian business to take advantage of the growing opportunities for sales and investment abroad as a result of the integration of Europe and of the extraordinary economic growth in Asia. A successful outcome to the multilateral trade negotiations in Geneva would be the best means to guarantee access for Canadian products in markets around the world; achieving that goal will be a high priority for my government.
At home, my government will work with provincial governments to ensure that Canada becomes a single, integrated market from coast to coast to coast. We need to eliminate:
-policies that favour a province's suppliers over lower cost producers from other provinces;
-regulations that often make it simpler for producers to ship their products abroad than to sell them in neighbouring provinces;
-hiring policies that give preference to provincial residents over those from other provinces; and
-occupational standards that restrict the work opportunities of residents of other provinces.
By one recent estimate, there are approximately five hundred barriers to interprovincial trade in Canada. My government's goal is to see barriers to interprovincial trade, services and investment come down by 1995, so that Canada becomes a single, integrated market. The savings to taxpayers and consumers of creating such a market could be as high as six billion dollars-about one thousand dollars a year for a household of four. And a larger home market would allow more Canadian companies to achieve the size and competitive edge to launch themselves successfully into world markets.
Today, investment and technology flow with ease across international boundaries, markets for goods and services are specialized and decisions on production are made on a world-wide basis. In the interdependent world we live in, prosperity is more and more a factor of knowledge, skills and innovation. The nations and firms that are succeeding and will continue to succeed in this environment are those whose people are educated, productive and able to adjust to rapidly changing circumstances. The risk for Canada is not so much to be undercut by developing countries with low-wage economies but to be outperformed by technologically advanced countries with highly paid, highly skilled workers.
Increasing our productivity across the full range of Canadian industry-resources, and services-is the only way to secure and enhance our prosperity over the longer term. Productivity is the difference between prosperity and decline. The prosperity of all Canadians and our ability to maintain social programs depend on the productivity of Canadians. Increasing productivity requires the collaborative efforts of governments, business, labour and individual Canadians, in all regions. To focus this effort, specific targets will be set.
Canadian business, workers and governments will be asked to work together to generate at least two and a half million new jobs by the year 2000 and to raise the real incomes of Canadians by at least twenty-five percent, by the same year. These targets are realistic and achievable in a united Canada, whose population will approach thirty million people by the end of the century and whose gross domestic product will approach one trillion dollars.
My government believes that building Canadian prosperity and securing Canada's natural environment are fully compatible goals. International experience demonstrates conclusively that the most economically prosperous nations are also the most environ- mentally conscious nations. To safeguard our natural heritage, my government introduced this country's first comprehensive environment plan-the Green Plan-during the last session.
Over the coming months my Minister of the Environment will be implementing a wide range of Green Plan initiatives. These initiatives, in concert with action on the part of the provinces and the private sector, will ensure that Canadians, today and tomorrow, have the clean air, water and land essential to sustaining human health and enhancing our quality of life. They will also encourage the development of ``environmentally friendly'' products for which there are growing markets abroad.
We must, all of us, come to grips with the fundamental issues involved in integrating environmental and economic considerations into our decision-making. My government will, over the coming months, consult with provincial governments, industry and environmental leaders to explore means of complementing current regulatory approaches with innovative instruments that would achieve positive environmental results without prejudicing economic prosperity.
Increasing economic prosperity is first and foremost an issue of people. Canada's ability to prosper in a global economy will be determined by the level of Canadians' educational achievement, by the sophistication of our management skills and by our attitudes to work and to change. In the dawning knowledge age, how well we live will depend on how well we learn.
Canadian men and women must have access to both the skills and the lifelong learning opportunities necessary to improve their job prospects and ensure their own prosperity. But Canadians are questioning whether this country's approach to learning, despite the great dedication of so many talented educators and administrators, is adequate for the times. The issue is not exclusively, or even primarily, money.Canada already spends more money per capita on education than almost any other industrialized nation does. Every year the federal government alone spends about eleven billion dollars, directly and indirectly, on education and training. The issue is results.
-Three out of ten students drop-out of high school before graduating.
-Four out of ten adults cannot read or do math well enough to perform everyday tasks.
-Canadian industry spends less than half as much on training its employees as American industry does, a fifth as much as the Japanese and an eighth as much as the Germans.
This is not the kind of performance that will guarantee increasing prosperity for our children; in fact, it has given rise to concerns whether the next generation of Canadian men and women will be the first to have a lower standard of living than their parents. The time has come to reach a national consensus on performance, goals, partnerships and priorities for learning. As part of my government's new agenda for prosperity, a discussion paper on learning will be published to stimulate and focus discussion on education and training.
My government recognizes that education is a provincial responsibility under the constitution and respects that fact. My government also recognizes that Canadians are concerned about education, and would like to see Canada-wide goals established, with provincial endorsement and cooperation, for the year 2000. These goals could include:
-cutting illiteracy rates in half;
-ensuring that ninety percent of Canadians attain high school diplomas or the equivalent by age twenty-five;
-doubling the number of post-secondary graduates in mathematics, the sciences and engineering; and
-quadrupling the training provided by employers to their employees.
Students and parents, employers and employees, educators and governments will be asked to work together to develop a ``learning culture,'' just as we have developed an environmental culture. My government will, also, ask the newly created Labour Force Development Board to present proposals in this area. The objective is to equip Canadian men and women to participate fully in creating and sharing Canadian prosperity.
The full participation of Canada's aboriginal peoples in Canada's economic prosperity and political life is a goal shared across the country. To put itself in a position to respond more effectively to the needs of the aboriginal peoples of Canada, my government will appoint the Right Honourable Brian Dickson, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, to serve as a special representative of the Prime Minister in order to consult widely on the terms of reference and membership of the Royal Commission announced recently and report back to my government.
Particular care will be taken to ensure that the Commission neither delays nor negates constitutional, legislative or other reforms already under way. These reforms include land claim settlements, community development initiatives, education and other activities launched during the second session of the Thirty-Fourth Parliament. In cooperation with Indian people themselves, my government will explore alternatives to the Indian Act, especially concerning land, monies and self-government. Finally, my government will consult aboriginal Canadians on changes in the system of administering justice. The goal is to work with Canada's aboriginal peoples so that they control their own lives, can contribute to Canadian prosperity and can share fully in it.
Our children are the most important yet most vulnerable members of our society. Last September, at the Children's Summit in New York, the attention of people everywhere was focused on children at risk. Seventy-one leaders pledged that that moment would last a decade. My government will bring forward a plan to implement the commitments it made that day; the objective is to see Canadian girls and boys better educated, better protected and better nurtured so that they can make their own contributions to Canada's future. In addition, my government will review its policies in relation to the family, the most fundamental building block of Canadian society. And my government will appoint a blue ribbon panel of concerned Canadian men and women to inquire into the serious problem of violence against women in our society.
My government will lay before you proposals for programs and policies to remove the barriers still faced by disabled Canadians to full participation in Canada's political life and economic prosperity. The government plans to implement a five-year strategy that will resolve issues such as access to employment, training, housing and transportation, public sensitivity and community integration.
You will be asked to approve a number of other important legislative initiatives to advance the economic, social and international interests of Canadians. You will, also, be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Changing the Way Ottawa Works
Change is the hallmark of our age; in Europe, in Asia, in Latin America, old assumptions are being discarded and new principles are being adopted. In Canada, too, new problems require new solutions.There is a need for change in the way Parliament does business and in the way governments conduct their affairs. The goal is to ensure that Canadians' agenda is Parliament's agenda.
In the Thirty-Third Parliament, a committee of the House of Commons proposed far- reaching reforms to enhance the role of private members. During that Parliament, you implemented more than eighty-five percent of the committee's recommendations. And, at the end of the last session of this Parliament, further changes were passed to make it possible for members to spend more time at home with their constituents so that they can be more effective in representing the wishes of their constituents and more efficient in the conduct of House business.
Canadians exercise their democratic freedom by electing their representatives through secret ballot. During this session, you will receive the report of the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform established by my government. Canadians want to know that their elected representatives have the power and authority to represent them. My government will propose further reforms so that all Members of Parliament can fulfil better their obligations to their constituents.
The respect of the people for Parliament and Parliamentarians is essential for a healthy democracy. But the appearance, and sometimes the reality, of excessive party discipline and over-zealous partisanship, of empty posturing and feigned outrage have eroded that respect in Canada. Members will be asked, therefore, to consider new procedures for assessing legislation, for raising grievances on behalf of constituents and for questioning government. This will further enhance the role of individual members and afford them greater independence.
Change is also necessary in the ways governments conduct their affairs. Governments must be both effective and efficient, implementing necessary programs at the lowest cost to taxpayers. Canadians understand that their governments simply cannot afford to do everything that is demanded of them. In the past six and a half years, through prudent management, the growth of government operations has been curtailed. My government has privatized and eliminated twenty-four Crown corporations and streamlined virtually all government departments and agencies. Since 1984, ninety thousand employees have been removed from the payroll of the federal government and its agencies. During this session, my government will take that process further. A draft spending control bill to cap federal program spending will be referred to a parliamentary committee for consultations with Canadians. Legislation will also be introduced to create a debt servicing and reduction fund so that GST revenues, as well as monies from further privatization of Crown corporations and from voluntary contributions, will be used to service the national debt. Streamlining of government structures and operations to serve Canadians better and to save taxpayers' money will continue to be a priority of my government.
Better ways to conduct the business of government are being examined. Improvements in the management of the public service, started under the Public Service 2000 initiative, will continue. A public service reform bill will be introduced into Parliament in support of this renewal program. Additional special operating agencies will be created to provide better service to Canadians through more autonomy and a sharper focus on objectives. My government will, also, continue to privatize those government activities best done by the private sector, as well as wind up and consolidate other agencies in order to provide Canadians better value for their tax dollars.
Conclusion
You are meeting at a pivotal period in the life of Canada, a time to reinvigorate our country and to bring Canadians together in a renewed accommodation. My government will work with Canadians to achieve its goals of unity, prosperity and responsive government so that all Canadians feel themselves a part of this country, so that all Canadians have an equal opportunity to share in its bounty, so that all can see themselves reflected in its constitution and so that all will find the fulfilment of their aspirations in its future.
Honourable Members of the Senate, Members of the House of Commons, Ladies and Gentlemen, you will play a decisive role in the strengthening of Canada. History will be the judge of the decisions you make on these critical issues.
May Divine Providence be your guide."
36,35,1,1994-01-18,liberal,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Honourable Members of the Senate, Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the House of Commons.
The two and a half years that have passed since I last had the pleasure of addressing Parliament have brought many changes, to Canada and to the world. Our hopes for global peace have been raised and, in many places, shattered. In some countries today, democracy is under stress, its future uncertain.
Canadians, however, continue their unwavering commitment to democracy. Elections in this country are carried out as peaceful clashes of ideas, not of forces. The very fact that we are gathered in this chamber is, itself, testimony to the durability and wisdom of the process by which we govern ourselves.
Once again, we look forward to welcoming Her Majesty. This year she will travel to Nova Scotia and the Northwest Territories, and to British Columbia, where she will open the 1994 Commonwealth Games.
On October 25, 1993, Canadians chose a new Parliament and a new government. The Government has made a number of commitments to the people of Canada. They will be implemented.
On opening the first session of this Parliament, and on behalf of the Government, I make the following brief statements of government policy, which will be followed by legislation and other proposals by the Prime Minister and Ministers themselves.
The agenda of the Government is based on an integrated approach to economic, social, environmental and foreign policy.
In order to achieve this agenda, integrity and public trust in the institutions of government are essential.
My Ministers will insist upon integrity, honesty and openness on the part of those who exercise power on behalf of Canadians.
Specifically, an ethics counsellor will be appointed to advise Ministers and government officials and to examine the need for legislative change. Legislation will be placed before you to increase the transparency of the relations between lobbyists and the Government.
The Government is committed to enhancing the credibility of Parliament. Changes will be proposed to the rules of the House of Commons to provide Members of Parliament a greater opportunity to contribute to the development of public policy and legislation.
Measures to reform the pension plan of Members of Parliament, including the elimination of double-dipping, will be placed before you.
The Government attaches the highest priority to job creation and economic growth in the short term and the long term. To stimulate economic activity, an agreement has been reached with provincial and territorial governments for a joint federal-provincial-municipal infrastructure program. This program will proceed immediately.
The Government will reintroduce the Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Program. The Government will also create a Youth Service Corps to begin putting young Canadians back to work.
For longer-term job creation, the Government will focus on small and medium-sized businesses. The Government will work with Canada's financial institutions to improve access to capital for small business. A Canada Investment Fund will be created to help innovative leading-edge technology firms to obtain the long-term capital they need. To improve the diffusion of technology and innovation, a Canadian technology network will be created. To strengthen research and development, the Government will encourage technology partnerships between Canadian universities, research institutions and the private sector. The Government will also implement a Canadian strategy for an information highway.
The Government will promote better training for the managers of small businesses and greater access to strategic information on new technologies and new marketing opportunities. The Government will also work with the provinces to reduce the regulatory and paper burden on small businesses and to streamline the delivery of programs.
Job creation and economic growth also require Canadian firms, especially small and medium-sized businesses, to adopt an aggressive trading mentality to take advantage of export markets. With the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the implementation of NAFTA, the Government will assist Canadian companies to translate improved market access into greater export sales. The Government will pursue an activist trade policy so that Canadians may have improved access to expanding markets, particularly in the Pacific Rim and in Latin America.
The Government will ensure greater cohesion of federal activity in international business development and welcomes the agreement of the provinces at the First Ministers' meeting of December 21, 1993, to explore opportunities for reduced overlap and duplication in this area.
At the same time the Government will promote greater trade opportunities domestically. The Government is committed to working with all provincial governments to eliminate internal barriers to trade.
Job creation and sustained economic growth require an investment in people. The Government will work in partnership with the provinces and the private sector to help young people to be better prepared for the transition from school to the workplace. The Government will propose measures to improve job training as well as the literacy skills of Canadians. Funding for the National Literacy Program will be restored to its original level.
Canada's social security system must be responsive to the economic and social realities of the 1990s. The Government will announce an action plan for major reform of the social security system to be completed within two years. The Government will work closely and co-operatively with the provinces and will consult Canadians on the modernization and restructuring of our collective social security. New legislation will then be placed before Parliament.
The Government will pursue the fiscal discipline necessary for sustained economic growth. The budget will be tabled in February and will include measures to bring the federal debt and deficit under control in a manner that is compatible with putting Canadians back to work. The Government will work with the provinces to ensure that our shared fiscal challenge is dealt with co-operatively and creatively.
In collaboration with the provinces and as a result of consultations to be undertaken by the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance, the Government will replace the Goods and Services Tax.
It will be the policy of the Government to promote sustainable development as an integral component of decision making at all levels of our society. Special emphasis will be placed on pollution prevention and the development of ``green'' infrastructures and industries and their associated high-technology jobs. The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act will be proclaimed.
The East Coast fishery, which has provided a livelihood to thousands of families in the Atlantic provinces and Quebec, confronts significant challenges due to the groundfish resource collapse. The Government, working with industry and the provinces, will help those involved to become self supporting. The Government will take the action required to ensure that foreign overfishing of East Coast stocks comes to an end.
The Government will vigorously pursue its commitment to strengthen the fabric of Canadian life. The Government will introduce measures to enhance community safety and crime prevention. There will be measures to combat the high level of violence against women and children. Measures will be proposed to combat racism and hate crime. The Court Challenges Program and the Law Reform Commission will be restored. Amendments will be proposed to the Canadian Human Rights Act; and the Canadian Race Relations Foundation Act will be proclaimed.
Canada's universal health care system is founded upon the principles of the Canada Health Act. The Government is deeply committed to these principles and rejects any measure which undermines them.
A National Forum on Health chaired by the Prime Minister will be established to foster, in co-operation with the provinces, a national, public dialogue on the renewal of Canada's health system.
A Centre of Excellence for Women's Health will be established to ensure that women's health issues receive the attention they deserve.
Prenatal nutrition programs for low-income pregnant women will be created and expanded.
The Government will forge a new partnership with Aboriginal peoples, particularly in respect of the implementation of the inherent right of self-government. Legislation to further the implementation of northern claims settlements will be put before Parliament.
The Government will allocate additional funds for the support of post-secondary education for First Nations and will develop an Aboriginal head-start program.
Our cultural heritage and our official languages are at the very core of the Canadian identity and are sources of social and economic enrichment. The Government will announce measures to promote Canada's cultural identity.
The Government will ensure that Canada plays an active, internationalist role in the global arena. In light of the radical changes that have occurred in international affairs in the last few years, the Government will ask parliamentary committees to review Canada's foreign and defence policies and priorities.
This year will also mark the 50th anniversary of D-Day, and I look forward, on behalf of the people of Canada, to participating in commemorative ceremonies to mark the valiant efforts of our servicemen and servicewomen who participated in the liberation of Europe.
The Government will work vigorously to fulfil its responsibilities to ensure that federalism meets the needs of Canadians, recognizing that all Canadians share in the responsibility for making Canada work. It will be the policy of the Government to seek to clarify the federal government's responsibilities in relation to those of other orders of government, to eliminate overlap and duplication, and to find better ways to provide services so that they represent the best value for taxpayers' dollars and respond to the real needs of people.
By working co-operatively to create economic opportunity; by restoring common sense to our public finances; by rebuilding a sense of integrity in government; and by pursuing a positive and innovative agenda for our society, my Ministers are convinced that Canadian unity will be preserved and enhanced. They believe that this Parliament can play a historic role in preparing Canada for the new century to come.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate/Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
37,35,2,1996-02-27,liberal,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Honourable Members of the Senate;
Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the House of Commons:
A year ago when I became Governor General, I spoke about the generosity and the compassion of Canadians. I spoke especially of the unsung heroes, the volunteers and helpers who encourage and care for their communities.
Since then, travelling to almost every province, I have seen how much Canadians love their country and how generous and open they can be to those in need. I have discovered the great strength of those currents of generosity and compassion.
In the schools and the Scout troops and in every part of life, from the nurseries of the newborn to palliative care for the dying, Canadians give endless help to one another. Surely this must be the most giving of countries.
We are developing a new award to recognize the unsung heroes of Canada; and hundreds of Canadians have already put forward the names of their fellow citizens, to honour their constant help and their open hearts.
On the opening of the second session of this Parliament, and on behalf of the Government of Canada, I make the following brief statements of government policy. The Prime Minister and Ministers will expand on this in coming days. Legislation and other administrative measures will follow.
2
Twenty-eight months ago, Canadians elected a new Parliament and chose a new government. Since then, the Government has acted to meet its commitments to the Canadian people. Ministers have insisted upon the highest standards of integrity and honesty in fulfilling their mandate.
The Government approaches the second half of its mandate confident that what unites us as Canadians is far greater than what divides us; certain that the values we share as Canadians are as relevant today as they have been at any time during our history; and determined to apply basic Canadian values and principles to the new policies and fresh approaches that are required to prepare ourselves and our national institutions to deal with the challenges of the 21st century.
Canadians are concerned about economic uncertainty, the sustainability of social programs and the unity of the country. The scope and enormity of the challenges are such that no individual, municipality, province or region acting in isolation can expect or hope to address them successfully. It will take the will to reason together and to pull together. Each of us must join with those with whom we have the most in common, with whom we share the most at the most basic level-at the level of values. And when we reflect on it, we realize it is with other Canadians that we have the most in common. And when we look at our history, and at our place in the world, we know we can solve our problems.
Ensuring Opportunity: A Strong Economy
A strong economy is the essence of a strong society. A strong economy creates the ability to translate into reality the values of equality of opportunity, compassion for the underprivileged and protection of the vulnerable.
Government has a necessary and essential role in facilitating change in society. Many Canadians are concerned about their security, and particularly their security of employment. The Government will work with the private sector and the provinces to make the collective investments required to produce hope, growth and jobs. Because government does not have the resources to do everything, it must be strategic in its approach. It must invest in people. The Government will focus its new initiatives on youth, science and technology, and trade.
Youth
Young Canadians want the opportunity to put their energies and talents to use. Young Canadians deserve a climate of opportunity. This must be a national objective.
It is time to harness the energy of the Team Canada partnership abroad between the federal and the provincial governments and the private sector to create hope, opportunity and jobs for young people at home. The Government will challenge the provincial governments and the private sector to enter into a domestic Team Canada partnership to create such opportunity for young people. In particular:
-The Government will announce measures to double the number of federal summer student jobs this summer. The Government challenges the business community and provincial and municipal governments to do likewise.
-The Government will work in active partnership with the provinces, the private sector and young people themselves to prepare initiatives to enhance youth job opportunities so that young Canadians can get work experience.
-The Government will challenge business and labour and all levels of government to work together to create new approaches to assist young people in finding their first job.
Science and Technology
To create enduring jobs for Canadians in the economy of the 21st century, investment in knowledge and technology is essential. The Government will establish guiding principles to improve the effectiveness and focus of the federal science and technology effort. In particular:
-The Government will make specific proposals to support technology development in the aerospace industry, in environmental technologies, and in critical enabling technologies such as biotechnology. Further measures will be taken to promote technology diffusion, including the launch of a Canadian technology network.
-The Government will support technological innovation by providing a predictable policy and regulatory framework for the information highway.
-The Government will continue to expand the access to the School Net and Community Access programs so that Canadians, particularly those in rural communities, will be able to use technology to increase their knowledge and access to each other and to the rest of the world.
Trade
Canadian jobs and growth depend heavily on our exports. Every one billion dollars of exports means 11,000 Canadian jobs. The success of ``Trade Team Canada'' demonstrates the value of working together to succeed in world markets and therefore create job prospects at home.
Further ``Trade Team Canada'' missions will be undertaken under the leadership of the Prime Minister.
To create jobs at home, the Government will announce new measures to enhance export development and financing, with emphasis on developing new products and new exporters and attracting new foreign investment.
The Government will continue efforts to expand NAFTA and will work towards more world trade liberalization.
Where there are trade disputes, the Government will spare no effort to promote and defend legitimate Canadian trade rights and interests.
3
A Climate for Economic Growth and Job Creation
In the first half of its mandate, the Government has taken steps to ensure that the economic and fiscal conditions are in place for sustained growth and job creation. The Government has made major structural reforms. The deficit has been cut. International trade and investment initiatives have been undertaken. Much has been accomplished. Canadians are beginning to see dividends, particularly with lower interest rates.
But the job is not yet completed. The Government will continue to take appropriate action to promote a proper climate for economic growth and jobs. In particular:
-The 1996 Budget will set out how the Government will attain its deficit-reduction targets, bringing the deficit down to two percent of gross domestic product in 1997-98 and ensuring that further progress will be realized in 1998-99 and beyond.
-The Government will work with the provinces to conclude discussions on sales tax harmonization and establish a process to replace the GST and provincial sales taxes with a national sales tax.
-The Government will introduce proposals to strengthen the economic framework with legislative improvements in the areas of competition, bankruptcy and copyright.
-The Government will introduce proposals to update legislation governing financial institutions to ensure that it continues to be relevant to the emerging needs of businesses and consumers.
-The Government will propose a modernization of the rules governing labour relations under federal jurisdiction through changes in Part I of the Canada Labour Code.
-The Government will ensure through regulatory reform that requirements are strong and clear, delays are minimized and activities co-ordinated between departments and between levels of government.
-The Government is committed to the economic renewal of rural Canada. The Government will address the problems facing rural Canadians in a way that is tailored to their needs. Rural Canada is rich in natural and human resources and faces different challenges than urban areas. The Government will move forward in the coming session to make sure that all Canadians benefit from economic prosperity.
Ensuring Opportunity: Security for Canadians
Economic growth is not an end in itself. Government has the obligation, in accordance with basic Canadian values, to ensure security for Canadians in a rapidly changing world. Our legacy to future generations must include the assurance for all Canadians, wherever they live, that there will be a modern and accessible health care system; that a helping hand will be available when a helping hand is needed; that a public pension system will be there to support people in their old age; that our environment is protected; and that Canadians will be safe in their homes and communities.
A Secure Social Safety Net
The Government is committed to ensuring opportunity through a sustainable social safety net for the future. The Government will secure Canada's social union for the future and will adapt our federal arrangements as necessary to meet current challenges and to prepare for the next century. The Government is open to new ways and new directions to pursue our values. In particular:
-The Government will work with the provinces and Canadians to develop by mutual consent the values, principles and objectives that should underlie, first, the Canada Health and Social Transfer and, building on this, the social union more generally.
-The CHST consists of tax points and cash. The Government will announce plans to put a floor under the cash transfer component to provide a guarantee of continuing federal cash to the provinces. This will serve to secure Canada's safety net, particularly medicare.
Canadians attach high priority to our health care system and to the principles of medicare. The Government reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the five principles of the Canada Health Act. The Government will continue to work with the provinces to ensure the future of our publicly financed health care system.
Canadians expect to have secure elderly benefits and pensions available to them when they retire.
-The Government will propose to Parliament measures to sustain Canada's elderly benefits system for the future.
-The Canada Pension Plan will be made sustainable for future generations. Discussions are already under way with the provinces on possible changes. A joint federal-provincial paper setting out the problems and challenges facing the Plan has already been released for public consultation. And reforms will be legislated once the required provincial consent has been obtained.
Equality of opportunity is a basic Canadian value. It begins with children. The Government will announce measures to improve Canada's child support system, with the particular objective of helping single parents and low-income working families.
Security for Canadians means ensuring that people who are out of work can get help while they are unemployed and can get help to go back to work.
-The Government will implement a new Employment Insurance System beginning July 1, 1996. The Government will ensure that the legislation, while respecting the fiscal parameters of the proposed reforms, is responsive to the realities of the Canadian job
4
market and that the impact of changes does not fall unfairly on workers who are most in need of support.
-The Government will accelerate its current discussions with the provinces on labour market training and development to ensure the orderly withdrawal of federal activity in training, and to explore new approaches and the appropriate roles and responsibilities of each level of government for strengthening national and local labour markets.
Environmental Security
While sustaining the social safety net is an essential element of security for Canadians, it is not all. The quality of Canada's natural environment is a matter of national pride. Security for Canadians means sustaining our environment. All Canadians must work together to protect the environment. In particular:
-The Government will propose the modernization of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
-A federal Endangered Species Protection Act will be introduced.
-Legislation to ratify the UN Straddling Stocks Agreement and the Law of the Sea Convention will be presented to Parliament.
-The Government will promote the long-term conservation and revitalization of the Pacific salmon fishery and continue with the revitalization of the east coast fishery.
National parks are the heritage of a nation. The Government will seek agreements with provincial and territorial governments and with First Nations to establish new national parks and national marine conservation areas.
The solutions to many environmental problems lie outside our borders. The Government will continue to play an environmental leadership role both at home and in the international arena.
Personal Security
The non-violent character of our country-safe homes, safe streets-is also an essential element of security for Canadians. The Government will focus corrections resources on high-risk offenders while increasing efforts to lower the number of young people who come into contact with the justice system. The Government will develop innovative alternatives to incarceration for low-risk offenders. Criminal procedures will be reformed to better serve victims of crime.
International Security
In an interdependent world, security means taking an active role on the international stage. All Canadians strongly identify with, and take great pride in, the role Canada plays in the world. The Government will continue to work in the G-7, NATO and the United Nations for a more stable and peaceful world. It will pursue a wider spread entrenchment of democracy, and greater respect for human rights.
In keeping with its commitment to advancing human rights and dignity, the Government will make the rights of children a Canadian priority and seek an international consensus to eliminate exploitative child labour.
The Government will pay special attention to addressing the growing crisis of confidence in the United Nations, which Canadians rightly regard as the most important multilateral organization to ensure international peace and security.
Canada will also do its part to help keep and build peace in Bosnia, Haiti, the Middle East and elsewhere.
A Modern and United Country
Canadians have a common history, a common collective experience, a shared territory, and institutions that are uniquely our own. The Government will act to preserve this heritage.
Canadians also agree upon the values and principles which bind us together and give us confidence in ourselves and in each other.
On October 27, the people of Canada came together in their own communities and in Montreal to demonstrate as never before the will to stay together. On October 30, the people of Quebec voted in a referendum to stay in Canada.
At the same time, the referendum result gave a clear message that Quebeckers want change in the federation. This desire for change is broadly shared across Canada. The Government will act on a responsible agenda for change for all of Canada.
In the last two years, the Government has made significant changes in a number of areas. The Government will work with the provinces and individual Canadians to ensure that the Canadian federation is modernized to meet the needs of the 21st century. This modernization must be respectful of our diversity and be based on partnership and dialogue. Canadians want and expect governments to be flexible and to operate efficiently and effectively so that the country functions well. In particular:
-The Government will not use its spending power to create new shared-cost programs in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction without the consent of a majority of the provinces. Any new program will be designed so that non-participating provinces will be compensated, provided they establish equivalent or comparable initiatives.
-There are areas where, in the 21st century, the federal government does not have to be involved. For example, components of Canada's transportation infrastructure are being transferred to community-based groups, municipal authorities and the private sector.
5
-The Government is prepared to withdraw from its functions in such areas as labour market training, forestry, mining, and recreation, that are more appropriately the responsibility of others, including provincial governments, local authorities or the private sector.
-The federal government will propose to the provinces a much strengthened process to work in partnership, focussing on such priorities as food inspection, environmental management, social housing, tourism and freshwater fish habitat.
The federal government has an important contribution to make in preserving and modernizing Canada's social union so that the caring society remains Canada-wide in scope. In particular:
-The Government will work with the provinces and Canadians to develop agreed-upon values and principles to underlie the social union and to explore new approaches to decision making in social policy.
-The Government will continue to protect and promote unhampered social mobility between provinces and access to social and other benefits, and will work with the provinces to identify new and mutually agreed approaches.
The federal government has a major role to play in strengthening the Canadian economy and the Canadian economic union. The Government will work with the provinces to take concrete steps to further improve the functioning of the Canadian economic union. In particular:
-The Internal Trade Agreement, which came into effect in July 1995, must be improved. The government will work with the provinces and the private sector to achieve a much more open agreement.
-The Government is prepared to work with the provinces and other partners to reduce or eliminate remaining barriers to labour mobility.
-The Government is prepared to work with interested provinces towards the development of a Canadian Securities Commission, a single food inspection service, and a national revenue collection agency.
The Government welcomes public participation in the debate about Canada. It will encourage Parliament to reach out to Canadians to seek their views on the specific components of an agenda for change.
A First Ministers meeting will be called in the months ahead to discuss how governments can better work together for job creation in Canada, how to secure the social safety net and how to put into place a common agenda for change to renew Canada.
The Government intends to focus its energies on positive action to prepare Canada for the 21st century. The Government welcomes the commitment of the new government of Quebec to focus all its energies on the real problems of its citizens. The Government will work in collaboration with the Government of Quebec and all provincial governments on an agenda of economic renewal and job creation.
But as long as the prospect of another Quebec referendum exists, the Government will exercise its responsibility to ensure that the debate is conducted with all the facts on the table, that the rules of the process are fair, that the consequences are clear, and that Canadians, no matter where they live, will have their say in the future of their country.
The Government recognizes that national unity is more than a re-balancing of roles and responsibilities of levels of government.
At a time of globalization of the economy, Canada is especially well placed to compete because of two official languages and the many Canadians who speak languages other than English and French. The Government recognizes that because of the minority status of the French language in North America, French-speaking Canadians have legitimate concerns. The Government affirms that it is particularly important to reinforce a Francophone presence at home and abroad. Such a presence contributes to our national identity and is a source of strength and enrichment for our country.
Action has already been taken to recognize Quebec as a distinct society within Canada and to guarantee that no constitutional change affecting any major region of the country will take place without the consent of that region. The Government supports the entrenchment of these provisions in the Constitution.
National unity means reminding Canadians of what they have in common. The Government will put forward a series of measures with special emphasis on helping Canadians, particularly young Canadians, to broaden their experience of Canada and to learn more about their country. A new Citizenship Act will be introduced to better reflect contemporary views of the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.
Culture is at the core of our identity as Canadians. The Government is committed to strong Canadian cultural industries. The Government will propose measures to strengthen culture in Canada and will ensure continued access to our own cultural products in order to maintain a balance between Canadian perspectives and those from abroad. The Government reaffirms its commitment to ensuring the long-term vitality of the CBC, the National Film Board and Telefilm Canada as institutions which interpret Canada to Canadians and to the world.
The Government believes that one of the tests of Canadian values is our ability to incorporate the aspirations of Canada's Aboriginal peoples. The recent historic Nisga'a agreement in principle shows that this is possible. The Minister of Indian Affairs
6
and Northern Development will continue to pursue other initiatives in partnership with Aboriginal people and other governments.
Honourable Members of the Senate;
Members of the House of Commons:
In looking to the 21st century, it is essential that the federal government, in its own policies and programs, be dedicated to providing modern, flexible public services-services that are accessible, affordable and responsive to the needs of clients and citizens. The Government acknowledges the contribution of the Public Service of Canada to the continuing achievement of its goals. Further measures will be introduced to enable more flexible and innovative methods of service delivery.
By working in partnership throughout Canadian society to create jobs and economic opportunity, to provide the security of a modern social safety net, and to preserve national unity, the Government affirms that a legacy of hope can be left to future generations.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
May Divine Providence guide all of you in your deliberations."
38,36,1,1997-09-23,liberal,"     Honourable Members of the Senate,
    Members of the House of Commons,
    Ladies and Gentlemen:
My wife, Diana, and I were happy to welcome Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh when they arrived in Canada last June and to be their hosts during their stay in the National Capital over Canada Day.
As Governor General I have visited every province and territory, and I wish every Canadian could share that experience. Our cities, towns, and villages reflect the diversity of all those who have come to this country. And yet our communities, whether on the coasts or the prairies, whether in the woodlands or on the northern tundra, show the same friendliness, openness, and generosity.
People care for each other in many ways, and they give their time and their support to their community.
When I became Governor General, I stated my intention to honour the generosity of Canadians, especially as demonstrated by volunteers. We have now created the Caring Canadian Award to recognize the most dedicated among them.
In my functions, I visit with many units of the Canadian Forces. They have impressed me with their dedication, as demonstrated by their peacekeeping role, their heroic work in search and rescue, and their immediate response to natural disasters such as the Saguenay region and Red River floods.
Let me mention another source of great pride: the proclamation of the twenty-first of June, the longest day of the year, as National Aboriginal Day -- a day to honour the First Peoples of this land.
A New Parliament...
Today marks the opening of a new Parliament, the last Parliament of the 20th century and the first Parliament of the 21st century, a Parliament with a unique and historic opportunity to provide leadership on national issues to secure the future for Canadians.
On June 2, 1997, the people of Canada renewed the mandate of the Government. Over the course of this Parliament, the Government will fulfil the commitments it made to the people in its election platform.
The Parliament of Canada is the only institution directly elected by all Canadians with the mandate to protect and express the national interest. Elected by all Canadians and endowed with the legitimacy that this bestows, the Government of Canada will stand up for the shared values of Canadians at home and abroad.
But governing in the 21st century also means recognizing that no one government can act alone. Given the complexity of the issues that face us as citizens in a global economy, collaboration is an essential ingredient for the success of Canada. More than ever, Canadians want their governments to work together in partnership.
As we look forward to the beginning of a new millennium with new challenges and new opportunities, we can look back at the last century of Canadian history and state with certainty that Canada is rightly regarded, the world over, as an extraordinary success. Canada represents a triumph of the human spirit, bringing together the best of what people can do.
...For a New Century of Canadian Achievement
As the 21st century approaches, Canadians face changes in technology and information that are as profound as those of the Industrial Revolution and that are creating dramatic opportunities for our growth and development. As old and familiar constraints of time and distance are breaking down, individuals and communities can accomplish things once unimaginable.
Canada is ready. We are poised for success. Our citizens have the qualities that are needed to succeed in the 21st century:
    We have the values of sharing and mutual help.
     
    We are well educated.
     
    We welcome innovation and new ideas.
     
    We are an open and democratic society.
     
    We are a bilingual and multicultural country at a time of increasing globalization.
     
    We have learned to accommodate our differences and diversity and turn them into strengths.
 
Our federation makes the most of these talents. It gives us the cohesion we need to multiply our strengths by combining our talents, by pooling our resources and by sharing risks. It also gives us the flexibility we need to experiment and innovate in order to succeed in a rapidly changing world.
The Government wishes to recognize the important role of a professional, non-partisan public service in a well-performing civil society. Canada is served well by its public service, and the effort and dedication it exhibits in meeting the needs of citizens and in building partnerships among governments and other sectors of society. The Government will continue to renew the Public Service of Canada to ensure its members have the skills and dedication to continue serving Canadians well.
We Have Already Built a Foundation for Our Success
In recent years, Canadians worked hard and sacrificed to overcome many of our nation's challenges. We succeeded, and have started to put in place a strong foundation for our success in the new millennium.
This 36th Parliament opens at a time when we have brought order to our public finances, and the economy is entering a period of strong growth. While unemployment is still too high, hundreds of thousands of new jobs are being created by the private sector, inflation is at very low levels, and interest rates are lower than they have been in more than three decades. More Canadian companies are selling more goods and services to the world than ever before.
Stimulating job creation and economic growth has been, remains, and will continue to be a major objective of the Government of Canada. The Government will build on the progress achieved and the foundations put in place over the last four years to strengthen the economy and increase confidence. We will pursue this course and take further action to encourage new investment, to create new jobs, and to generate the national wealth necessary to assure Canadians a stable and secure future.
The Government will continue to be vigilant and responsible about keeping the financial affairs of the country in order:
    It will put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a permanent downward track.
     
    It will balance the budget no later than fiscal year 1998­99.
     
    It will seek to devote one-half of the surplus in this mandate to addressing the social and economic needs of Canadians. The other half will go to a combination of reducing taxes and the national debt.
     
    It will introduce legislation to implement the proposed changes to the Canada Pension Plan and the new Seniors Benefit in order to ensure Canada's public pension system remains sustainable in the 21st century.
 
One in three Canadian jobs depend on trade. Our prosperity and our ability to create jobs are directly linked to how well we capitalize on international opportunities. Team Canada trade missions have successfully generated new opportunities for Canadian businesses and have illustrated what we can accomplish when governments and the private sector collaborate. The Government will build on this success with a focussed strategy, developed in consultation with industry, to improve our international economic performance by expanding Canada's trade base, becoming the location of choice for global investment, and making Canada a preferred tourist destination.
The Government has regained the ability to address priorities of Canadians while living within its means. It is now in the position to make strategic investments in our children and our youth, our health, our communities, and our knowledge and creativity while continuing to improve the nation's finances.
The Government is committed to following this balanced approach of social investment and prudent financial management as it leads Canada toward renewed and lasting economic health and increased social cohesion.
As important as all of these accomplishments is the fact that the federal, provincial and territorial governments are developing new and better ways of working together. We are making the federation better able to serve the differing needs of Canadians across the country.
Canadians feel better about their own future and the country's future. We are looking to our future together with a new optimism. The fact that we have demonstrated our ability as a country to set ambitious goals and achieve them gives us new confidence to set higher goals for the
years ahead and succeed. We need to go beyond the limits of our expectations. It is the task of Parliament and the Government to rise to this new spirit of optimism.
Our Challenge for the Future
Our challenge is to ensure that no Canadian is left behind as the country moves forward. The future belongs to societies whose economy is sound; who invest in knowledge, education and innovation; whose population is healthy; whose children are well prepared to learn; and who focus on securing a high quality of life for all citizens. Canadians have already set these priorities for this new Parliament. These are the Government's priorities.
Building a Stronger Canada
The federal, provincial and territorial governments owe it to all Canadians to take responsible leadership on the unity of the country. The single most important commitment of the Government is to keep Canada united. The Government of Canada can have no greater duty or responsibility. The overriding goal of the Government of Canada as we approach the 21st century is both simple and ambitious. It is to strengthen and unite this country by joining in the common purpose of keeping Canada one of the best places in the world in which to live.
Our values of openness, tolerance and sharing, our qualities of social and linguistic diversity, and our high standard of living equip us exceptionally well for the challenges of the new age.
Canadians want a just and sharing society. A prosperous society. A tolerant and highly diverse society. A society that fosters excellence and creativity. Realizing these aspirations fully will require the active
engagement of Canadians in all walks of life, as well as our institutions, businesses, voluntary organizations and our governments. It will require collaboration and partnership. It will require reaching out.
The federal, provincial and territorial governments have been developing a more collaborative approach to strengthening and modernizing Canada's social union -- the new National Child Benefit System is an early result of this new approach. In their meeting last week, nine Premiers and the two territorial leaders reiterated their desire for closer co-operation with the federal government in the areas of health care and social policy. The Government welcomes the Premiers' and territorial leaders' continuing interest in working together, and is committed to even closer collaboration on these important issues. As a next step, the First Ministers will meet this fall to work on co-operative approaches to address youth unemployment, health care and social policy renewal.
The Government will take a very broad and encompassing approach to promoting and strengthening our unity. All its major initiatives will serve to make Canada better and thus more united. The Government will approach its mandate committed to collaboration and partnership with all its partners in Canadian society. Canada provides our common space and our common means for realizing our potential. We would all be forever diminished, forever changed, should we fail to maintain the example Canada provides to the world. Our future as a country is too precious for us to risk losing it through misunderstanding. Therefore, the Government will bring frankness and clarity to any debate that puts into question the future existence or unity of Canada. It will create a better understanding of the true complexity and difficulty for all of us in severing ties that have developed in building a nation together. Most of all, it will demonstrate how much more we can do together than apart.
The Government will work closely with provincial and territorial governments to further advance the progress made by nine Premiers and the territorial leaders last week in Calgary toward the full recognition of the diversity inherent in the federation, including the unique character of Quebec society.
We will build on the mutual respect Canadians have for one another to achieve our common aspirations for a better future.
Investing in Children
A country that has decided to invest in its children is a country that is confident in its future. A country that invests in its children successfully will have a better future. One of our objectives as a country should be to ensure that all Canadian children have the best possible opportunity to develop their full potential. We must equip our children with the capacities they need to be ready to learn and to participate fully in our society.
While families have the greatest responsibility in the nurturing and development of our children, they are not alone. Developing our children requires a concerted effort and partnership by parents, governments, and the private and the voluntary sectors. It requires focussing on what children need to thrive.
The experiences of Canada's children, especially in the early years, influence their health, their well-being, and their ability to learn and adapt throughout their entire lives. By investing now in the well-being of today's children, we improve the long-term health of our society. Addressing the needs of low-income families with children is therefore a priority of the Government.
Federal, provincial and territorial governments have agreed to address in a co-operative way the problems of low-income families with children. Together we are now building the comprehensive and effective National Child Benefit System.
The Government has already demonstrated its initial commitment to this project by increasing its contribution to the Canada Child Tax Benefit by $850 million a year, with higher payments to families beginning July 1, 1998.
The Government will work with its provincial and territorial partners to establish jointly a common timetable for increasing the federal contribution to the Canada Child Tax Benefit by at least an additional $850 million during the course of this mandate. The Government will also work with the provinces and territories to establish the National Re-Investment Framework to guide the re-allocation of our partners' savings into new services and benefits for low-income families with children.
We can make a difference in the lives of all our children. Children need a substantial investment of time and attention for healthy development; they need strong families; they need safe, supportive communities. The federal, provincial and territorial governments agreed in January 1997 to work together to develop the National Children's Agenda, a comprehensive strategy to improve the well-being of Canada's children.
Federal, provincial and territorial governments will work together to develop this broader agenda for children, including clear outcome measures by which to gauge success. As part of this national agenda, the federal government will undertake three new initiatives:
    It will establish Centres of Excellence to deepen our understanding of children's development and well-being and to improve our ability to respond to their needs.
     
    It will expand our Aboriginal Head Start program onto reserves to ensure that all Aboriginal children have the opportunity to get a good start in life.
     
    It will measure and report regularly on the readiness of Canadian children to learn, so that we can assess our progress in providing our children with the best possible start.
 
Investing in Quality Care and Good Health
For decades, the Canadian health care system has been a source of pride for Canadians: it reflects the fundamental values that Canadians most cherish. Our publicly financed system of health care is recognized at home and abroad as simply the best in the world.
Nonetheless, there is an increasing anxiety among Canadians about the present state and the future of our medicare system. Citizens worry about whether they will have access to the highest possible quality of health care when they need it. The anxiety arises from a number of sources, including the pace and extent of restructuring that has gone on in recent years.
The federal government recognizes that this restructuring has been difficult for Canadians and, therefore, it will increase health care funding to the provinces from previously budgeted levels. It will introduce legislation to increase to $12.5 billion a year the guaranteed annual cash payments to provinces and territories under the Canada Health and Social Transfer.
One of our goals as a country must be to continue providing all our citizens with access to the highest possible quality of health care and the other tools they will need to enjoy healthy lives as we move into the 21st century. Canadians have a right to expect their governments to work together in harmony to better meet the shared goals and desires of Canadians for a better health system.
The Government is firmly committed to a publicly administered, comprehensive health care system that provides universal access to high quality care for Canadians anywhere in the country.
The Government has a leadership role in preserving and enhancing medicare. It has a constructive role to play as a partner with provinces and other interested parties. The Government will play that role in a spirit of openness, pragmatism and innovation. There are steps that we can and will take to lead the efforts by all governments.
Preparing Canada for the 21st century means ensuring the medicare system meets the needs of the future. It means responding to emerging issues in health care. Working with its partners, the Government will undertake the following initiatives:
    It will take measures to support Canadians in responding to the expanding needs for home care and community care.
     
    It will develop a national plan, timetable and a fiscal framework for providing Canadians with better access to medically necessary drugs.
     
    It will improve the quality and effectiveness of health services across Canada by establishing the Health Transition Fund to help the provincial governments innovate in the areas of primary care and provide more integration in the delivery of health services, home care and pharmacare.
 
Canadians recognize that good health depends on much more than medical care. Our social and economic situations also help to determine the quality of our health. As a country, we must increase our efforts to promote healthy lives. The Government will contribute to this goal with an agenda to promote good health. Emphasis will also be placed on those factors that determine the health of a country's population, including the equality of economic and social opportunity for all citizens.
Some of the most urgent health problems today are found in Aboriginal communities. The Government will work with other partners and Aboriginal communities to
    develop new initiatives to address the rapid increase in tuberculosis and diabetes in Aboriginal communities; and
     
    enhance research and dissemination of health information focussed on the needs of Aboriginal people through a new Aboriginal Health Institute.
 
To fulfil other pressing health needs, the Government will expand the Canadian breast cancer initiative, renew the national HIV-AIDS strategy; and double the resources for the tobacco reduction strategy, with a particular focus on community-based programs to prevent young Canadians from starting to smoke and to encourage smokers to quit.
The Government will work with its provincial partners and other interested parties to improve Canadian health information systems to improve decision making about health and health care across the country.
Building Safer Communities
Safe communities are among the hallmarks of our Canadian identity. While the reported crime rate has decreased for four consecutive years, it is still too high. The Government is committed to ensuring that Canada remains a place where Canadians feel secure in their homes and on the streets of their communities. A safe society depends on strong crime prevention efforts as well as traditional legal responses. Governments around the world are developing community-based crime prevention programs.
The Government will help protect the right of all Canadians to feel safe in their communities by working with other governments, the private sector and voluntary groups. It will
    increase funding for community-based crime-prevention initiatives to $30 million per year;
     
    develop alternatives to incarceration for low-risk, non-violent offenders, such as sentencing reforms, community diversion programs, and alternative sanctions; and
     
    integrate information systems of all partners in the criminal justice system.
 
Creating Opportunity for Young Canadians
Today's generation of young Canadians is the best educated in our history. Young Canadians are living in a country well-positioned for opportunities in the new economy. Yet, the level of unemployment among Canadians between the ages of 18 and 25 is unacceptably high. The federal, provincial and territorial governments will act to address this problem, and First Ministers and territorial leaders will be working on this issue when they meet this fall.
To secure our future as a society, our immediate challenge is to make sure that our young generation makes a successful transition to the world of work, that young people who want to continue to learn have access to education, and that young people who found it difficult getting started in the workplace get a second chance.
All Canadians have a stake in meeting this challenge successfully. No single sector of society nor any one level of government has all the answers. We must all contribute, each in our areas of competency, to meet the challenge we have set for ourselves. The Government welcomes the action being taken by the private sector, through initiatives such as Career Edge and the Corporate Council on Youth in the Economy, and encourages the private sector to do more. The Government is committed to work with other governments, the private sector, communities and individual Canadians to help equip young people for the future.
An important role for governments is to ensure the widest possible access to post-secondary education. Canadians are concerned about the increasing cost of higher education, and the resulting debt burden on students. The Government took some important measures to address this problem in its budget of February 1997. The Government will continue to reduce barriers to post-secondary education through further changes to the Canada Student Loans Program, increased assistance for students with dependents, and new scholarships to encourage excellence and to help low- and moderate-income Canadians attend university or college.
The Government finds it unacceptable that thousands of jobs are going unfilled in high-growth sectors of our economy at the same time as young Canadians are unemployed. The Government will work with the provinces, universities and colleges, the high-tech industry and other rapidly growing sectors to better forecast the number and types of jobs that will be available and to develop a plan for ensuring that people are appropriately educated to fill them.
Three factors make a significant difference to young people getting started in the world of work -- a good education, a chance at a first job, and a mentor to work with as they establish themselves. The Government will increase its resources devoted to helping youth to make a smooth and productive entry into the world of work. Internship programs have been particularly successful in helping young people get started. These programs will be extended and expanded. Enhanced funding of student summer placements will be continued. In partnership with provincial governments and the private sector, a Canada-wide mentorship program will be developed.
To help those young Canadians who need a second chance, the Government will develop and expand community-based programs for youth with the greatest difficulty making the transition to the world of work because of low education and skills. These will include establishing multi-purpose Aboriginal youth centres that will provide targeted social and cultural support in addition to increasing work and learning opportunities for urban Aboriginal youth.
The Government will continue to support efforts of individuals, communities and other governments to improve Canadians' capacity to learn throughout their lives.
Investing in Knowledge and Creativity
The revolution in the knowledge and information economy is transforming all sectors of the economy from primary resources to service industries. Canada is well-positioned to be a world leader in the global knowledge-based economy of the 21st century. We have the talent, we have the resources, we have the technology, and we have the institutions.
By rising to the challenge of mobilizing our resources well, we can enable our citizens to succeed in the global knowledge-based economy. This is how we will spur continuing job creation and sustained growth in our standard of living in the 21st century. The Government is determined to do more to support innovation and risk-taking in Canada and to attract more foreign investment in knowledge-based industries to Canada. We will build creative partnerships between the private and public sectors to accelerate the adoption of innovative technologies in all sectors of the economy.
With targeted growth strategies, we will build those knowledge-intensive sectors where we are strong and where the opportunities for growth and global leadership is highest. Examples are aerospace; bio-pharmaceuticals; bio-technology in agriculture and fisheries; and the environmental, information, and telecommunications technologies. In particular, the Government will significantly increase the resources allocated to help small and medium-size businesses develop and commercialize new technology.
The Government will explore innovative policies and measures that give particular attention to increasing opportunity for Canadians in rural communities. It will adapt its programs to reflect the social and economic realities of rural Canada. Further, the Government will redouble its efforts to ensure that rural communities and all regions of Canada share in the economic benefits of the global knowledge-based economy.
Governments have a crucial role to play in supporting science, technology, and the creation of knowledge. The Government of Canada's endowment of the Canada Foundation for Innovation in partnership with the private sector, the provinces and universities, is helping to build a leading-edge national system of innovation. All levels of government must do more to provide public support for research done in our universities.
Support for knowledge goes beyond support for university research. Increasing support for the arts makes it possible for Canadian culture to reach audiences at home and abroad. Our movies, books, magazines, plays, videos, music, and multi-media productions speak to us about our experiences at the same time as they present Canadian creativity to the world. Therefore, the Government of Canada will provide increased support to the Canada Council and will make special efforts to support culture at home and to promote trade in Canadian cultural and educational products and services abroad.
We will make the information and knowledge infrastructure accessible to all Canadians by the year 2000, thereby making Canada the most connected nation in the world. This will provide individuals, schools, libraries, small and large businesses, rural and Aboriginal communities, public institutions, and all levels of government with new opportunities for learning, interacting, transacting business and developing their social and economic potential. For example, we will enhance the voluntary sector's capacity to engage Canadians by improving their access to the technology they need to play a stronger role in Canadian life.
A connected nation is more than wires, cables and computers. It is a nation in which citizens have access to the skills and knowledge they need to benefit from Canada's rapidly changing knowledge and information infrastructure. It is also a nation whose people are connected to each other. The Government will continue to work with provinces to ensure greater mobility for people with disabilities and to ensure their integration into the economic and social mainstream of Canadian life. The Government will also bring forward measures to strengthen networks among Canadians and to increase knowledge of Canada and understanding among Canadians; these measures will include enhanced exchange programs for young Canadians.
Expanding Opportunities in Aboriginal Communities
Thousands of years ago, Aboriginal people began building Canada's first communities. Today, by strengthening our Aboriginal communities, we are reinforcing the diversity that makes Canada unique in the world. The Government will
    develop relationships with Aboriginal people based on the principles of partnership, transparency, predictability and accountability;
     
    support the building of strong Aboriginal communities -- communities that provide their members with better living standards and opportunities; and
     
    strengthen the capacity for good government in Aboriginal communities.
     
    To contribute, the Government of Canada is committed to respond to the Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoplesas soon as possible.
Looking Outward
Our country has a tradition of being a responsible, engaged, committed world citizen. This is a key characteristic of our national identity and a source of pride to Canadians. Canada is a force for peace and understanding around the world, for bridging differences, and for finding common ground. Canada espouses the common humanity that binds together the human family.
This tradition is the legacy of Nobel laureate and former prime minister of Canada, Lester Pearson, whose 100th birthday we mark this year. Canadians want their government to carry on this tradition and give it new relevance as the world enters a new century.
Nothing better illustrates the ongoing commitment to this tradition than Canada's leadership since 1994 in the international effort to ban anti-personnel mines. This Canadian initiative has evolved from a bold idea to be the focus of a large and growing international consensus that will culminate in the signing of an international treaty in Ottawa in December of this year.
Canada's rich and diverse natural heritage is also a source of national pride and international acclaim. Canadians are both the beneficiaries and the stewards of a land that holds nine percent of the Earth's fresh water, 10 percent of its forests, and 25 percent of its wetlands.
Canadians both delight in our magnificent environment and fear for its future. Maintaining what is good, and improving what has been degraded, requires constant effort. It is an effort that the Government will make.
The Government is committed to working in the international community to promote sustainable development and to achieve practical solutions to global environmental problems, such as greenhouse gas emissions and toxic chemicals. It will also continue to address the serious international problem of over-fishing. It is committed to acting at home to reduce our contribution to these problems.
In this same Canadian tradition of internationalism, the Government will undertake the following initiatives:
    It will promote Canadian values on the world stage by co-operating with like-minded countries to revitalize the United Nations and
     
    other key multilateral institutions. It will work directly with other countries to enhance and promote human rights, peace building and democracy.
     
    It will destroy the Department of National Defence's stock of land mines, in advance of the signing of the Ottawa Treaty in December, to continue its leadership and illustrate its commitment to a global ban. And Canada will continue to work toward an accompanying international strategy to help land mine victims recover and civilian populations reclaim their land from these mines.
     
    It will continue to move forward with reforms to the Canadian military.
     
    It will continue its campaign for liberalized trade. Breaking down trade barriers, both within Canada and around the world, helps ensure markets for Canadian goods and services and provides the best opportunity for greater prosperity.
Celebrating the Millennium
For Canadians, the start of the new millennium represents an historic opportunity to celebrate our achievements as a nation and our hopes for the future. It will be an unequalled opportunity to show ourselves and the world the richness of our diversity, the strength of Canadian values, and the great promise of our future in the 21st century.
The Government will help build a partnership among governments, communities and citizens to mark the new millennium. Many Canadians have creative ideas and suggestions for millennium projects. There will also be an opportunity for parliamentarians from all parties to participate in developing ideas to mark the millennium.
Moving Forward into the 21st Century
Almost 100 years ago, Sir Wilfrid Laurier said, ""The 20th century shall be the century of Canada and of Canadian development."" He was right. Today, we have the opportunity for success in the 21st century that is far beyond what Laurier could have ever imagined.
To achieve this success we have more work to do -- work that no one can do alone. Each and every one of us must assume personal responsibility for our community and our country. Our greatest responsibility is to build a new spirit of sharing and mutual respect for a new century.
By working together, by respecting the value of our diversity, we will secure our future and build a stronger country. We will ensure that our future economic opportunities are sound, our children well prepared, our lives healthy, and our communities strong.
Each generation has the opportunity to choose the society it wants to leave for its children. The greatest legacy we can leave to our children in the new millennium is a vibrant living legacy that will make Canada a better place: a stronger country with a brighter future and greater opportunities for its young people. By working together, we will build that future.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate/Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
39,36,2,1999-10-12,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
It is an honour for me, today, to open this Second Session of the Thirty-Sixth Parliament of Canada. I appreciate having the opportunity so early in my mandate to represent the Queen as one of the three elements of Parliament. It is a responsibility which I take seriously, and I intend to follow your deliberations closely.
Unlike my immediate predecessors, I have not had the privilege of serving among you. I do, however, value highly the role that you play and the dedication that you show in making this remarkable institution work effectively as the centrepiece of the Canadian democratic system. I am very aware of the sacrifices that so many of you make in your personal and professional lives in accepting the challenges of public office. The commitment you have made is one that I share, and I look forward to working with you over the next five years in the service of the people of Canada.
Today, the representatives of the Canadian people gather to open the session of Parliament that will carry the country into the new millennium.
We stand before a new century confident in the promise of Canada for our children and grandchildren. Technology is altering every aspect of our lives. Knowledge and creativity are now the driving force in a new economy. And collaboration is becoming more essential as the issues facing our diverse society grow in their complexity. But Canadians will succeed in this changing world, just as we have succeeded throughout our country’s history.
The promise of Canada was born in an age when countries were forged through war or revolution. Our nation’s founders chose a unique path, which has become the Canadian way – creating a country dedicated to peace, order and good government for all its citizens. It took foresight and commitment to break the mould of the nation-state founded on a single language, culture or religion. That foresight and commitment have been greatly rewarded.
Canada began as a small colony with little industry and no role of its own in global affairs. Over generations, individual Canadians built a better future for their families and their communities. Canadians and their governments overcame barriers of distance and a harsh northern climate to build a national railway, a system of highways, a postal service, and national cultural institutions, as well as hospitals, universities, and other institutions. Canadians and their governments also put in place a modern social safety net. Together, these achievements have provided the foundation for our quality of life.
Within a few generations, we evolved into an independent nation with an advanced industrialized economy and a voice in the councils of the world: the United Nations, the G-8, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, NATO, and many others. Canada is now serving its sixth elected term on the United Nations Security Council.
Ours is a voice for peace. Canada was the first to propose the use of troops for peacekeeping. Today, Canadians are keeping the peace in many countries around the world. But whenever tyranny has threatened peace and security, Canadians have never hesitated to answer the call. Together with our proud Canadian veterans, we remember those who paid with their lives at Vimy Ridge, on Juno Beach, and at Hill 355 in Korea.
In the tradition of the coureurs des bois, we have explored the frontiers of science. From the invention of newsprint to the creation of advanced computer languages, Canadian ingenuity has helped to build the information age. From the discovery of insulin to the earliest pacemaker, Canadians have given new life to millions around the world. Canada was a pioneer in the peaceful use of space, becoming a leader in satellite communications and remote-sensing technologies. Today, our astronauts are using Canadian technology to help assemble the International Space Station – the largest scientific project in history.
In a complex world, diverse approaches, skills and ideas are essential to building a higher quality of life. Canada is a bilingual country in which both men and women of many different cultures, races and religions participate in economic, social and political life. Our diversity is a source of strength and creativity, making us modern and forward-looking.
Our actions and our history make us at home in a world of change and increasing interdependence. Our human talent, our values and our commitment to working together will secure Canada’s leadership in the knowledge-based economy.
Today, Canadians can look with pride on Canada’s success. We have a dynamic economy, a strong and democratic society, and a sense of community. We are recognized throughout the world for our quality of life. We will build a higher quality of life for all Canadians – for our children, ourselves, and our neighbours.
 
A Strong and United Canada
A high quality of life for Canadians and a strong, united Canada are inseparable. The Government will continue to take a comprehensive approach to strengthening the unity of our country. All its actions will serve to strengthen Canada by enhancing the quality of life of Canadians.
Our federal system allows us to value the different strengths of each region of our country. It guarantees all citizens equal rights and freedoms. And it enables Canada’s wealth to be shared by all citizens no matter where they live – from Newfoundland in the east, to British Columbia in the west, to our newest territory, Nunavut, in the north.
Over the last two Parliaments, Canadians have built a foundation for even greater success. Our economy is strong. Our citizens enjoy expanding opportunities and increasing choices. Our artists, writers, musicians and filmmakers draw admiration from around the world. And Canada itself earns the respect of the community of nations as a symbol of peace, democracy and compassion.
The best way to achieve the promise of Canada for every citizen is to work together to build the highest quality of life for all Canadians. But there are some who would pull us apart rather than bring us together. Even though Quebeckers do not want a third referendum, the Government of Quebec continues to talk about holding another one. The Government of Canada therefore reaffirms the commitment it has made to Quebeckers and all other Canadians that the principle of clarity, as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada, will be respected.
To seize the opportunities and meet the challenges of a new global economy, we must work together in the Canadian way and concentrate on what matters most to Canadians. We must take bold steps today to make Canada even stronger in the next century. This requires national will, national strategies and partnerships across the country. Citizens and governments must collaboratively build an even stronger and more united Canada, a Canada that remains an example to the world.
Canadians expect their national government to focus on areas where it can and must make a difference. And they want this done in the Canadian way – working together, balancing individual and government action, and listening to citizens. Canadians expect their Government to be fiscally prudent, to reduce the debt burden, to cut taxes, and to pursue the policies necessary for a strong society. The emerging global marketplace offers an enormous opportunity to create more Canadian jobs, more Canadian growth and more Canadian influence in the world. It provides expanding opportunities to secure a higher quality of life for all Canadians. To seize these opportunities, we must build on our strengths.
Achieving a higher quality of life requires a comprehensive strategy to accelerate the transition to the knowledge-based economy, promote our interests and project our values in the world. Together, we will strive for excellence. This demands that we collaborate with our partners to:
    develop our children and youth, our leaders for the 21st century;
    build a dynamic economy;
    strengthen health and quality care for Canadians;
    ensure the quality of our environment;
    build stronger communities;
    strengthen the relationship with Canada’s Aboriginal peoples; and
    advance Canada’s place in the world.
 
Children and Youth: Our Leaders for the 21st Century
Our Children
Because of the changing nature of the world economy, the prospects for a high quality of life in any country will depend – as never before – on having a population that is adaptable, resilient and ready to learn throughout life. The foundation for this is laid in the very early years. No commitment we make today will be more important for the long-term prosperity and well-being of our society than the commitment to invest our efforts in very young children. Parents and families have the primary responsibility for the care of their children. But all of society must work together to ensure that our children develop the abilities to succeed.
The Government will extend and make more accessible Employment Insurance benefits for parental leave, to help parents take more time from work to spend with their children. It will make its own workplace policies and those of federally regulated employers more family friendly. Through further tax relief, it will put more dollars in the hands of families with children. And, with its provincial and territorial partners, it will work to reform family law and strengthen supports provided to families to ensure that, in cases of separation or divorce, the needs and best interests of children come first.
Federal, provincial and territorial governments are developing together the National Children’s Agenda. As part of this work, it is the Government’s objective to reach an agreement among governments by December 2000 on a national action plan to further support parents and families. This plan will be consistent with the Social Union Framework Agreement. It will set out common principles, objectives and fiscal parameters for all governments to increase resources and further strengthen supports for early childhood development.
To make it easier for families to break the cycle of poverty, the federal, provincial and territorial governments also established the National Child Benefit. The Government of Canada is already investing an additional $1.7 billion annually in low-income families with children, while the provinces and territories are investing in complementary services. The Government wants no family to have to choose between a job and benefits for their children. Therefore, by 2002, the Government will make a third significant investment in the National Child Benefit, while seeking a commitment from its provincial and territorial partners to increase their investment in services for families with children.
 
Young Canadians
Young Canadians are the leaders of tomorrow. Already, they are at home in the wired world. They have energy, ideas and technological savvy, and they want to contribute to building their country in the 21st century. In our global and connected world, young Canadians are acquiring knowledge and skills at an earlier age. They deserve more and earlier opportunities to get involved, develop their talents and expand their skills. In doing so, they will become active and engaged citizens.
The Government will focus on providing young people with more opportunities to connect to the Canadian experience, to view their country in all its splendour, to gain a first-hand understanding of the different regions, and to be challenged by what they learn from their fellow citizens across this land. The Government will:
    draw on the expertise of young Canadians to help connect rural and urban communities to the information highway, by hiring them to put in place additional Internet access sites for public use;
    create a single-window service – Exchanges Canada – to give 100,000 young Canadians every year the chance to learn about another part of the country;
    ensure that younger Canadians – from age 13 – are given an opportunity to apply their creative abilities, by providing them with a chance to produce their ""first works"" using traditional approaches and new technologies in the arts, cultural, digital and other industries;
    actively engage tens of thousands of young Canadian volunteers to participate in community and national environmental projects and to help others improve their literacy skills; and
    enable young Canadians to apply their energy and talents overseas, by participating in international internship programs and helping developing countries get connected to the Internet.
 
In addition, the Government will continue to place a priority on providing young Canadians with career information, access to work experience, and learning opportunities.
 
A Dynamic Economy for the 21st Century
In the global, knowledge-based economy, the advantage goes to countries that are innovative, have high levels of productivity, quickly adopt the latest technology, invest in skills development for their citizens, and seek out new opportunities around the world.
Canadians have built a strong and dynamic economy. It is the cornerstone of our quality of life – providing Canada with the means to continue building a more equitable society, a healthier population, and stronger communities. In the space of only a few years, our nation’s finances have gone from deficits and debt to balanced budgets, with low inflation and low interest rates. Laws and regulations have been modernized and the role of government in business decisions has been reduced.
The Government will continue to build a better environment for economic growth and enhanced productivity by reducing the debt burden, cutting taxes, and making strategic investments. Such investments will help small businesses grow, encourage trade, support citizens in developing the skills they need, and ensure that Canada has modern infrastructure.
The Government is committed to prudent fiscal management. It will never let the nation’s finances get out of control again. It will keep the ratio of debt to GDP on a permanent downward track. It will deliver on the commitment it made at the beginning of this Parliament to devote half the budget surplus to debt repayment and tax relief, and the other half to investments that address the social and economic needs of Canadians.
Lower Taxes
As the nation’s finances have improved, the Government has begun to deliver broad-based tax relief – totalling $16.5 billion over three years. As the nation’s finances continue to improve, the Government will further reduce taxes to increase the disposable income of Canadians, enhance innovation and risk taking, and create a more robust economy.
Tax reduction is a key component of a strategy to increase individual incomes and to ensure an economy that produces the growth and wealth which enable those public and private investments necessary for a high quality of life.
In its next budget, the Government will set out a multi-year plan for further tax reduction.
Increased Trade and Investment
Canada’s economy is more open than any of the leading industrialized countries. We are blessed with a population that comes from countries all over the world. Foreign markets for our goods and services provide us with new opportunities. Foreign investment provides us with capital, new ideas, new technologies, and innovative business practices.
To build on Canada’s advantage, the Government will increase its trade promotion in strategic sectors with high export potential – sectors ranging from biotechnology and environmental and information technology to tourism, culture and health. It will also continue to support innovation and the development of new technologies in leading export sectors such as agriculture, agri-food and natural resources.
It will launch Investment Team Canada – a co-ordinated effort by all governments and the private sector to make the international community more aware of the unique opportunities for investment and growth in Canada. The Government will also modernize legislation to make it easier for global corporations to locate their headquarters in Canada.
The Government will use the upcoming round of World Trade Organization negotiations, including those on agriculture, to help build a more transparent, rules-based global trading system – one that ensures a level playing field, provides better access to world markets for Canadian companies in all sectors, and respects the needs of Canadians, our culture, and the environment. In addition, the Government will work with its partners in the hemisphere toward the establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005.
Skills and Knowledge for the 21st Century
A skilled workforce and a capacity to innovate continuously are crucial building blocks of a successful 21st century economy.
Over the last three years, the Government has put in place a strategy to build on Canada’s advantage as the country with the most highly educated workforce in the world. It has made it easier to save for a child’s education. It will make college and university more affordable through Canada Millennium Scholarships. It has improved student debt relief and provided better tax assistance to finance lifelong learning.
We will continue to build on this strategy. The Government will forge partnerships with other governments, public- and private-sector organizations, and Canadian men and women to establish a national action plan on skills and learning for the 21st century. This plan will focus on lifelong learning, address the challenge of poor literacy among adults, and provide citizens with the information they need to make good decisions about developing their skills.
Over the next two years, the Government will work with its partners to:
    enable skills development to keep pace with the evolving economy. This work will be led by the Sectoral Councils, which bring together representatives from business, labour, education and other professional groups to address human resource issues in important areas of the Canadian economy;
    make it easier for Canadians to finance lifelong learning; and
    provide a single window to Canada-wide information about labour markets, skills requirements and training opportunities – on the Internet, over the telephone or in person in communities across the country.
To ensure that the Public Service of Canada remains a strong, representative, professional and non-partisan national institution that provides Canadians the highest quality service into the 21st century, the Government will also focus on the recruitment, retention and continuous learning of a skilled federal workforce.
Infrastructure for the 21st Century
For Canada to generate jobs, growth and wealth, it must have a leading, knowledge-based economy that creates new ideas and puts them to work for Canadians. To do this, it is essential to connect Canadians to each other, to schools and libraries, to governments, and to the marketplace – so they can build on each other’s ideas and share information. Achieving this objective will require new types of infrastructure.
Knowledge Infrastructure
Improving Canada’s knowledge infrastructure means supporting a new generation of leaders, attracting the best researchers, and encouraging our graduates to put their talents to work here at home.
The Government will introduce the legislation necessary to create the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. These institutes will provide a model for world-leading research, bringing together for the first time all the researchers who have an impact on health to undertake shared research priorities. This innovative approach recognizes the importance of collaborative research for improving the health and well-being of Canadians and for building a high-quality health system.
The Government of Canada has for many years been one of the most important contributors to research at Canadian universities. In the last two years, the Government has pursued an ambitious agenda to improve its support for advanced research in Canada. To build on this agenda, the Government will:
    increase its support to the Granting Councils, enabling them to forge new partnerships with our universities to attract the best research minds in the world through an innovative program of 21st Century Chairs for Research Excellence;
    foster greater international research collaboration by Canadian universities and institutes and expand Canadian expertise in such areas as genomics, climate change, and advanced engineering; and
    find new markets for new products and services developed through research by universities and government research centres.
The Government will also ensure that it has a modern and effective research and science capacity to promote the health, safety and economic well-being of Canadians.
Information Infrastructure
Improving Canada’s information infrastructure will support the exchange of ideas and the conduct of business over computer networks, connect Canadians to the information highway, and accelerate the adoption of electronic commerce. The Government will:
    take steps to make Canada a centre of excellence for electronic commerce and encourage its use throughout the economy;
    re-introduce legislation to protect personal and business information in the digital world and to recognize electronic signatures; and
    provide increased access to high-speed Internet service for classrooms and libraries and stimulate the production of Canadian multimedia learning content and applications. This will build on the success of SchoolNet.
The Government will become a model user of information technology and the Internet. By 2004, our goal is to be known around the world as the government most connected to its citizens, with Canadians able to access all government information and services on-line at the time and place of their choosing. We will build on a pilot project now under way to make www.access.ca a personal gateway to government information and community content on the Internet, and we will encourage all Canadians to make use of this address.
Our knowledge-based economy is more than high-tech companies. It is an economy in which all sectors strive to use leading technologies and processes. It is an economy in which old barriers to access or of distance matter less – where technology enables urban and rural communities from the Atlantic to the West to the North to compete globally, and where technology opens new doors to all Canadians. It is an economy in which rural Canada also benefits from value-added activity, environmentally astute land management, and new job skills and opportunities. It is an economy in which clusters of technology development already exist in smaller communities all over Canada. Indeed, it is an economy in which technology can lead to greater economic stability for the primarily rural regions in which cyclical resource industries – agriculture, fisheries, forestry, mining and tourism – are the dominant sources of wealth. The Government will encourage the development and adoption of new technologies in all sectors.
Cultural Infrastructure
The strength of Canada is reflected in its rich diversity. Across this country, Canada’s culture comes alive through our writers, singers and performers, through our filmmakers and artists, and through those who chronicle our history and preserve our heritage.
New technologies offer new opportunities to strengthen the bonds between Canadians. The Government will bring Canadian culture into the digital age, linking 1,000 institutions across the country to form a virtual museum of Canada. It will put collections from the National Archives, National Library and other key institutions on-line. It will also increase support for the production of Canadian stories and images in print, theatre, film, music and video. In particular, it will increase support for the use of new media.
Physical Infrastructure
Canada must also continue to improve its physical infrastructure for the 21st century. To increase trade and economic growth, we must ensure that we have the capacity to move people and goods safely and efficiently. To maintain the quality of life in our cities and rural communities, we must ensure that we have clean air and water.
The Government will work with other levels of government and the private sector to reach – by the end of the year 2000 – agreement on a five-year plan for improving physical infrastructure in urban and rural regions across the country. This agreement will set out shared principles, objectives and fiscal parameters for all partners to increase their resources directed toward infrastructure. It will focus on areas such as transport, tourism, telecommunications, culture, health and safety, and the environment.
 
Health and Quality Care for Canadians
Good health and quality care are essential to the well-being of all Canadians and are part of our strength in today’s global marketplace. Advances in technology, research and information are opening tremendous new opportunities for improving the health and well-being of citizens.
Canadians expect their governments to work together to ensure that Canada’s health care system is modern and sustainable. The Government recently reaffirmed its commitment to medicare by investing an additional $11.5 billion to modernize the health system for the beginning of the 21st century. The Government will continue to move forward with its provincial and territorial partners and the health care community on common priorities.
With its partners, the Government will support the testing of innovations in integrated service delivery in areas such as home care and pharmacare, working toward a health system in which all parts operate seamlessly. As the results of these innovations become available, we will be better able to make informed decisions about the next significant investments in health – ensuring that our health system meets the evolving needs of all Canadians.
A modern health information system will give health professionals and individual citizens improved access to up-to-date information about health issues and treatment options. The Government will ensure that citizens in every region of the country have access to such information so they can make better-informed decisions.
The Government will protect the health of Canadians by strengthening Canada’s food safety program, by taking further action on environmental health issues, including the potential health risks presented by pesticides, and by modernizing overall health protection for a changing world.
We will also continue to address the serious health problems in Aboriginal communities, supporting their efforts to promote wellness and to strengthen the delivery of health services.
 
The Quality of Our Environment
The long-term economic and social well-being of every Canadian depends on the state of our natural environment. Canada’s ability to adopt innovative environmental practices and technologies will increasingly be part of Canada’s strength in the 21st century.
Canadians have long recognized the underlying relationship between a healthy environment and a high quality of life. Canadians and leading businesses are already working in their own communities to preserve the natural environment, pushing the frontiers and opportunities of environmental technologies and new eco-efficient practices.
The quality of the environment in our communities is also linked to the environmental health of other communities around the world. Problems such as climate change and dangerous levels of persistent toxins can be resolved only through concerted international action.
Within Canada, the Government will work with other governments and citizens to meet our country’s commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will set and enforce tough pollution standards, in particular to better protect the health of children, seniors and residents of the North. It will place greater emphasis on sustainable development in government decision making. It will also address the structural weaknesses that have been identified in the management of toxic substances. Internationally, Canada will provide technical assistance to developing countries in adopting sustainable practices.
The Government will introduce legislation and stewardship programs, working with provinces and territories to ensure that species at risk and their critical natural habitat are protected. The Government will also continue to extend Canada’s national parks system.
In its own operations, the Government will make itself a model of environmental excellence. It will do more to clean up contaminated federal sites. It will strengthen its capacity for conducting environmental science research. It will also explore new environmental clean-up technologies.
The Government will report regularly on the results achieved in addressing the top environmental concerns of Canadians.
 
Building Stronger Communities
Working Together
Our history has been one of Canadians helping Canadians to seize opportunities and rise to challenges. This commitment to working together – by Canadians, their governments and their communities – will ensure Canada’s continued success in addressing the complex issues of the 21st century.
The Social Union Framework Agreement, reached earlier this year, is a commitment by governments to work together for Canadians. It calls for governments to report publicly on the effectiveness of social programs. It also commits governments to eliminating barriers that unjustifiably impede the mobility of citizens within Canada. These barriers include rules that prevent some citizens from obtaining recognition of their qualifications when they move to another province, that deny some students use of their student loans when they study out-of-province, and that restrict access to essential services for some citizens – including those with disabilities – because of their province of origin. The Government of Canada is committed to working together with its partners to meet the deadlines set out in the Social Union Framework Agreement, thereby removing all unjustifiable barriers to mobility no later than 2002.
In 2001, Canadians will mark the International Year of Volunteers – a time to celebrate the achievements of Canada’s everyday heroes. The Government recognizes the need to build partnerships with communities and to renew its relationship with the voluntary organizations that serve and sustain them. The Government will enter into a national accord with the voluntary sector, laying a new foundation for active partnership with voluntary organizations in the service of Canadians.
Strong communities depend on the participation of all their members. To this end, the Government will pursue its efforts with other governments, the private and voluntary sectors, and all citizens to build communities in which Canadians with disabilities are fully included and in which new Canadians feel more at home.
In addition, the Government will continue working with its partners in all sectors to address the root causes of homelessness and help communities respond to their members’ needs for shelter and other support.
Promoting Safer Communities
Canadians are justifiably proud of having built communities where citizens feel safe. This is a key component of our quality of life and a contributor to Canada’s comparative advantage.
The Government will work with Canadians to ensure that our communities continue to be safe. Its focus will be balanced, combining prevention and a community-centred approach with action to deal with serious crime. It will expand the community-based crime prevention strategy and re-introduce legislation to reform the youth justice system. The Government will combat drug trafficking while helping communities aid those most affected. It will also launch a program of restorative justice to help victims overcome the trauma of crime and provide non-violent offenders with a chance to help repair the damage caused by their actions.
The Government will focus attention on new and emerging threats to Canadians and their neighbours around the world. It will work to combat criminal activity that is becoming increasingly global in scope, including money laundering, terrorism, and the smuggling of people, drugs and guns.
The Government will strengthen the capacity of the RCMP and other agencies to address threats to public security in Canada and work with enforcement agencies in other countries. In addition, it will work to modernize legislation to better ensure public security.
The Government of Canada will also continue to work closely with the Government of the United States to modernize our shared border for the 21st century.
 
A Stronger Relationship with Canada’s Aboriginal Peoples
The contribution of Canada’s Aboriginal peoples has shaped our country’s heritage and will continue to enrich Canada in the new century. The Government will continue to build on the strong foundation of reconciliation and renewal created by Gathering Strength – Canada’s Aboriginal Action Plan.
We are now building stronger partnerships with Aboriginal people – concentrating on improving their living conditions and, increasingly, on strengthening their economies. As a result, Aboriginal people will be able to more fully participate in and contribute to Canada’s economic development and social well-being.
Fostering good government and strong accountability in First Nations communities will increase investor confidence, support economic partnerships, and improve living conditions. Land claim agreements, in particular, are essential to create certainty for Aboriginal people and their surrounding communities – providing the climate needed for partnerships, investments and economic opportunities. Early in the new session of Parliament, the Government will introduce legislation to implement the historic agreement with the Nisga’a.
 
Canada’s Place in the World
As we move into the 21st century, Canada has the momentum to lead the way toward a safer and more secure world. Canadians have built the highest quality of life in the world by focussing on the needs of people. We have the expertise to advance an agenda of human security – protecting people from threats to their rights, their safety and their lives.
Canada is an outward-looking country, with a trade-oriented economy and a population drawn from every corner of the globe. We have a reputation internationally for making a difference – through our contribution to eliminating landmines, our work with NATO and the United Nations in Kosovo, our development assistance to Asia and Africa, our efforts to establish the International Criminal Court, and our work to renew the international financial system.
As the Cold War recedes into the past, there is a greater need to complement national security with an approach that addresses the growing challenges that undermine the security of individuals. Human security is challenged when children are used as soldiers in combat, when citizens are denied their rights, when civilians are caught in conflict, and when people are the victims of economic crisis, natural disaster, widespread disease, or environmental degradation.
Canadians recognize that their quality of life depends in part on the quality of life of their neighbours – those who share this planet with us. A world where people are secure is a world where fewer people are forced to flee their homes, where there is less crime and terrorism, and where there is a reduced threat of disease and pollution.
The Government will give increased prominence to human security in its foreign policy, working to achieve meaningful progress in the councils of the world on a global human security agenda.
In 2001, the United Nations General Assembly will hold a special session on children. In the spirit of partnership that led to the historic treaty banning landmines, the Government will work to reach key international agreements to protect the rights of children. Canada will champion efforts to eliminate the exploitation of children, including the use of child soldiers in armed conflict, and will help address the crisis of children affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
The Government will act with like-minded countries to reform and strengthen international institutions such as the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank and World Trade Organization. It will also work to develop a new approach internationally to support the diversity of cultural expression in countries around the world.
To advance Canada’s leadership in the Arctic region, the Government will outline a foreign policy for the North that enhances co-operation, helps protect the environment, promotes trade and investment, and supports the security of the region’s people.
The Government will increase international development assistance and work in innovative ways to enable poor countries to improve the quality of life of their citizens.
The Government will also continue to ensure that the Canadian Forces have the capacity to support Canada’s role in building a more secure world and will further develop the capacity of Canadians to help ensure peace and security in foreign lands.
 
Honouring Canada’s Promise for the 21st Century
As we prepare to celebrate the turn of the millennium, we can look to our past with pride and to our future with confidence. Like previous generations, we will face new challenges. But guided by our values and our collective experience, we can ensure that Canada remains the best place in the world in which to live – the best place to raise children, to learn, to pursue opportunity, to share in rich, diverse and safe communities, and to admire the beauty of nature.
All Canadians – every citizen, every government, every business and every community organization – have a part to play. We will build the 21st century together.

You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate and Members of the House of Commons:
As the representatives of the Canadian people across this great land, yours is a special duty – a higher responsibility to strive for excellence in the service of your country.
Let the Canadians of tomorrow look upon this Parliament and say, Here were men and women committed to building a stronger Canada and a better quality of life for their children and grandchildren.
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."

Ladies and Gentlemen:
It is my great pleasure to greet you on this first day of the 37th Parliament since Confederation. The vital relationship that exists between the Canadian people and Parliament is what we celebrate today through history, custom and symbolism.
I also have the pleasure of welcoming new members to the House of Commons, and I want all parliamentarians to know how deeply I appreciate the ideals that motivate you to serve your country. I also appreciate the sacrifices brought on by your task and made in the name of the common good and of leadership. And in a healthy democracy, leadership can come from everyone, because it is a sense of really knowing what you want and what you can contribute.
A little more than a year ago, I became Canada’s 26th Governor General. I set out as the main objective of my first year in office to visit every province and territory and to meet as many Canadians as possible, wherever they live and make their lives — to engage in a true dialogue with them. I have seen many places that Canadians have decided to call home, from big cities to small hamlets, from the Island of Montreal to Ellesmere Island.
But what we call home is more than a place name on a map. It is our belonging to a community of ideas and ideals; it is the knowledge that we can say something and be listened to, and the conviction that we can respect, rely upon and help each other.
Meeting Canadians across the country has given me the opportunity to hear about the different challenges we face. Looking at these issues, we of course remember that we have demonstrated, time and time again, that we have the self-confidence to act, and to act successfully. Change does not frighten us — we have always harnessed it to our advantage.
It is often said that our country’s strength lies in its diversity. Why is this so? Because diversity imposes serious responsibilities. Indeed, if we accept our place in a rich and successful society, we must also acknowledge and engage with the parts of our society that are less advantaged.
The Government has been given a third mandate by Canadians. In leading Canada into the new millennium, its overarching goal will continue to be to build a stronger, ever more inclusive Canada and secure a higher quality of life for all Canadians. In pursuing this aim, the Government will carry out the commitments set out in its election platform.
Canada is proud, optimistic and strong. The Government has achieved the critical objective of restoring the nation’s finances. The economy continues its longest period of economic expansion since the 1960s. Inflation and interest rates are low and stable. More than two million new jobs have been created since 1993. Significant new investments are being made in children and youth, in innovation and skills, in health care, and in the environment.
As we enter this new century, Canada and Canadians face the challenges of competing in a faster-paced, technology-driven world economy. Of responding to economic uncertainty among our trading partners. Of continuing to strengthen the fabric of our society in an era of increasing globalization. And of advancing our Canadian interests and values in the international arena.
We must ensure that every region, every province and territory, every community, and every citizen has a strong voice and can contribute to building our nation. To bring the benefits of our prosperity to all communities, whether urban, rural, Northern or remote. To promote innovation, growth and development in all parts of our economy, including our agricultural and resource sectors and our manufacturing and service industries.
Canadians must rise to these challenges. Success in our more interdependent and complex world will require the contribution of all Canadians. The Government of Canada, for its part, will focus on:
    building a world-leading economy driven by innovation, ideas and talent;
    creating a more inclusive society where children get the right start in life, where quality health services are available to all, and where Canadians enjoy strong and safe communities;
    ensuring a clean, healthy environment for Canadians and the preservation of our natural spaces; and
    enhancing our Canadian voice in the world and our shared sense of citizenship.
In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Government of Canada will be guided by the values of Canadians. It will work with other levels of government, the private and voluntary sectors, and individual citizens.
It will continue to set bold goals and work toward them in a pragmatic, step-by-step way. It will continue to be a prudent steward of the nation’s finances as it focusses on the priorities of Canadians. Its efforts will be affordable and sustainable. The Government reaffirms its commitment to balanced budgets.
To assist the Government in fulfilling its responsibilities, Canada must have a public service distinguished by excellence and equipped with the skills for a knowledge economy and society. The Government will seek bright, motivated young women and men to accept the challenge of serving their country in the federal public service. The Government is committed to the reforms needed for the Public Service of Canada to continue evolving and adapting. These reforms will ensure that the Public Service is innovative, dynamic and reflective of the diversity of the country — able to attract and develop the talent needed to serve Canadians in the 21st century.
The Government will help to create opportunity for Canadians and ensure that opportunity is shared by all. This is the Canadian Way for the 21st century.
Creating Opportunity
An innovative economy is essential to creating opportunity for Canadians.
An innovative economy is driven by research and development. It requires a highly skilled work force and investments in new technology. A business environment and tax policies that encourage smart risk taking and entrepreneurship and that reward success. An attractive environment for investment. And a strong global brand for Canadian excellence.
An innovative economy is one where the benefits of new ideas are shared by every sector and every region — from East to West to North, from office workers to farm families.
Canada has laid a solid foundation for success in the new economy. Our economic fundamentals are among the best in the world. Spiralling debt and deficits have been replaced by social and economic investments, tax cuts and debt repayments. On January 1st of this year, most elements of the Government’s comprehensive and broad-based package of $100 billion in tax relief took effect.
We are better positioned than at any time in the last three decades to seize the opportunities of the global economy and to weather a short-term slowing of growth experienced by Canada’s major trading partners.
Innovation
To secure our continued success in the 21st century, Canadians must be among the first to generate new knowledge and put it to use.
Our objective should be no less than to be recognized as one of the most innovative countries in the world. Achieving this will require a comprehensive approach and the support and participation of all governments, businesses, educational institutions, and individual Canadians.
We must strive for Canada to become one of the top five countries for research and development performance by 2010. This is a challenge for all Canadians, but in particular for the private sector as the largest research investor in Canada.
As its contribution, the Government will at least double the current federal investment in research and development by 2010. In making new investments, the Government will:
    continue to pursue excellence in Canadian research by strengthening the research capacity of Canadian universities and government laboratories and institutions;
    accelerate Canada’s ability to commercialize research discoveries, turning them into new products and services; and
    pursue a global strategy for Canadian science and technology, supporting more collaborative international research at the frontiers of knowledge.
New federal investments will include strategically targetted research that is co-ordinated with partners. These investments will directly benefit Canadians in areas such as health, water quality, the environment, natural resources management, and oceans research. Among its investments, the Government will increase support for the development of new technologies to assist Canadians with disabilities.
Research in life sciences will benefit all of Canada, particularly our agricultural and rural economies. The Government will help Canada’s agricultural sector move beyond crisis management — leading to more genuine diversification and value-added growth, new investments and employment, better land use, and high standards of environmental stewardship and food safety.
Skills and Learning
Canada will only realize its full potential by investing aggressively in the skills and talents of its people.
To succeed in the knowledge economy, Canada will need people with advanced skills and entrepreneurial spirit. Canada’s youth are optimistic, technologically savvy, globally connected and the most highly educated generation in our history. The Government will continue to help young Canadians contribute to their country, gain employment, and apply their business and creative skills.
Building a skilled work force must be a national effort. The Government of Canada will work with provinces and territories and with non-governmental organizations to ensure that all Canadians, young and old, can achieve their learning goals. Canada must see at least one million more adults pursue learning opportunities during the next five years.
The Government will also help adults who want to improve their skills, but who may face difficulty in finding the time or resources to do this while providing for themselves and their families. It will create Registered Individual Learning Accounts to make it easier for Canadians to finance their learning. And it will improve the loans that are available to part-time students, so more workers can learn while they earn.
Some Canadians face particular challenges in upgrading their skills and enhancing their education. The Government will take steps to make it easier for them to access skills and learning.
    Youth at risk are among the most likely to drop out of school or to have difficulty in making the transition from school to work. The Government will work with its partners to ensure support for youth who particularly need help staying in school or getting their first job.
    Today, many Canadian adults lack the higher literacy skills needed in the new economy. The Government of Canada will invite the provinces and territories along with the private sector and voluntary organizations to launch a national initiative with the goal of significantly increasing the proportion of adults with these higher-level skills.
    Persons with disabilities face barriers to full participation in the economy and society. The Government of Canada will work with the provinces and territories and other partners toward a comprehensive labour-market strategy for persons with disabilities.
    Increasing numbers of Aboriginal people are developing their business skills and competing in the new economy. The Government will work with Aboriginal people to help strengthen their entrepreneurial and business expertise.
Immigrants have enriched Canada with their ideas and talents. The Government will take steps to help Canada attract the skilled workers it needs. It will also work in co-operation with the provinces and territories to secure better recognition of the foreign credentials of new Canadians and their more rapid integration into society. The Government will re-introduce changes to immigration legislation to streamline and improve the immigration system.
Connecting Canadians
The Government has helped to make Canada one of the most connected countries in the world, yet the speed of change continues to accelerate. Canada must continue to develop and strengthen its information infrastructure.
The private sector today is expanding high-speed access to the Internet in many regions. The National Broadband Task Force will advise the Government on how Canadians together can achieve the critical goal of making broadband access widely available to citizens, businesses, public institutions and to all communities in Canada by 2004.
The Government will continue to support the Community Access Program and SchoolNet, ensuring that Canadians, their communities and their schools can have an on-ramp to the information highway. These programs are critical to Canada’s effort to close the digital divide, particularly in rural, remote, Northern and Aboriginal communities. The Government will also enhance SchoolNet, focussing on creating more and better learning content on-line.
The Government will continue to work toward putting its services on-line by 2004, to better connect with citizens.
It will also modernize federal privacy law to safeguard the personal information of Canadians and provide better copyright protection for new ideas and knowledge.
Trade and Investment
The Government’s investments in innovation, skills and connectivity, as well as its reduction of corporate taxes and improved treatment of capital gains, are making Canada one of the most attractive places to invest and to do business. In addition, the Government will:
    ensure that Canadian laws and regulations remain among the most modern and progressive in the world, including those for intellectual property and competitiveness; and
    re-introduce legislation to promote a strong and efficient financial services sector that will benefit the Canadian economy and all Canadians.
The Government will work closely with the United States, Canada’s most important trading partner, to maintain secure and efficient access to each other’s markets. It will continue the joint work begun to modernize the shared border.
At the Third Summit of the Americas in Quebec City this April, the Government will advance work toward creating the Free Trade Area of the Americas.
The Government will also launch a branding strategy to raise awareness of the advantages of investing in Canada. As part of this effort, the Government will continue its successful Team Canada trade missions and launch Investment Team Canada missions to the United States and Europe.
Sharing Opportunity
The Canadian Way recognizes that economic and social success must be pursued together. We cannot build a prosperous society in the absence of economic growth. We cannot lead in innovation and new ideas without healthy and secure citizens. We must not pursue our interests in the world without strengthening our distinct culture and values here at home.
Nowhere is the creation and sharing of opportunity more important than for Aboriginal people. Too many continue to live in poverty, without the tools they need to build a better future for themselves or their communities. As a country, we must be direct about the magnitude of the challenge and ambitious in our commitment to tackle the most pressing problems facing Aboriginal people. Reaching our objectives will take time, but we must not be deterred by the length of the journey or the obstacles that we may encounter along the way.
The Government is committed to strengthening its relationship with Aboriginal people. It will support First Nations communities in strengthening governance, including implementing more effective and transparent administrative practices. And it will work to ensure that basic needs are met for jobs, health, education, housing and infrastructure. This commitment will be reflected in all the Government’s priorities.
Children and Families
Securing a good start in life for children is the only way to ensure that they are ready to learn, to seize opportunity as adults, and to contribute to the building of their country.
There was a time in Canada when retirement often meant facing a new life of hardship. A generation ago, Canadians set a national goal to eliminate poverty among seniors, and we have made significant progress.
There was a time in this country when falling sick meant risking one’s life savings. Working together, Canadians built a national, publicly funded health care system to ensure access to quality care for every citizen regardless of income.
There was a time when losing a job also meant immediate loss of income for workers and their families. And so Canadians created Employment Insurance.
Now Canadians must undertake another national project — to ensure that no Canadian child suffers the debilitating effects of poverty.
Canadians and their governments have already taken significant steps in this direction.
A strong economy and job creation have been essential to reducing poverty and ensuring that families have the resources to care for their children. But economic growth alone is not enough. Governments also have a key role to play in helping families left behind and in providing support to families and children.
All governments have put in place a range of measures to help families and children. The National Child Benefit is the cornerstone of our collective efforts to provide children with a better start. It is the single most important social program to be introduced in this country since medicare in the 1960s. The Government of Canada’s contribution to the National Child Benefit will continue to rise over the next four years.
Most recently, the Government of Canada and provinces and territories launched the Early Childhood Development initiative to expand and improve access to services for all families and children. The Government of Canada is investing more than $2 billion in this initiative over five years. As part of this agreement, governments will begin reporting to Canadians on the outcomes of their programs and services for children. These reports will give the Government of Canada and its partners the information they need to take whatever additional steps are necessary to provide Canadian children with a better start in life.
The Government of Canada will also take immediate action with its partners where the challenges are greatest.
    Single parents and their children often face special challenges overcoming poverty. The governments of Canada, New Brunswick and British Columbia have been testing new approaches to help single parents become more self-sufficient. The Government of Canada is prepared to test innovations with other provinces and territories, with the longer-term aim of developing new measures that help these parents overcome poverty.
    The Government will work with its partners on modernizing the laws for child support, custody, and access — to ensure that these work in the best interests of children in cases of family breakdown.
    It will improve the support available to parents and caregivers in times of family crisis. No Canadian should have to choose between keeping their job and providing palliative care to a child. The Government will take steps to enable parents to provide care to a gravely ill child without fear of sudden income or job loss.
    In securing a better future for Aboriginal children, the Government will work with First Nations to improve and expand the early childhood development programs and services available in their communities. It will also expand significantly the Aboriginal Head Start program, to better prepare more Aboriginal children for school and help those with special needs.
    The Government of Canada will also co-operate with Aboriginal communities and provinces and territories on the measures required to reduce the number of Aboriginal newborns affected by fetal alcohol syndrome. No child should experience this syndrome, but Canada’s immediate aim must be to significantly reduce its incidence in the Aboriginal population by the end of this decade.
Good Health and Quality Care
A healthy Canadian society is built on the health and well-being of individual Canadians and the health of our communities.
Canadians place a high priority on good health and on their health care system. We know that our system of medicare, which ensures access to needed services regardless of income or place of residence, is vital to our quality of life. It is a Canadian advantage and deeply valued by all citizens.
The Government of Canada will uphold the Canada Health Act. It will work with the provinces and territories to ensure that all governments continue to fulfil their commitment to the principles of medicare.
Governments in Canada have come together to strengthen and renew Canada’s health care system. Last September, First Ministers affirmed the commitment of their governments to the principles of the Canada Health Act and endorsed a health action plan that will enable them to move forward in building a modern, integrated and sustainable health system for Canadians.
Over the next three years, governments will take concrete action to reform and support innovation in primary care, to adopt modern health information technologies, and to purchase needed diagnostic and medical equipment. For its part, the Government of Canada is committing more than $21 billion in new funding to the provinces and territories over five years through the Canada Health and Social Transfer.
The Government will also champion community-based health promotion and disease prevention measures.
    It will strengthen its efforts to encourage physical fitness and participation in sport, and take further steps to combat substance abuse, reduce tobacco consumption, prevent injuries and promote mental health.
    It will advance progress on disease prevention, focussing in particular on reducing the incidence of preventable diabetes and tuberculosis — especially among Aboriginal people, who suffer disproportionately from these diseases.
    The Government will also provide a further major increase in funding to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. The new funding will enable the Institutes to enhance their research into disease prevention and treatment, the determinants of health, and health system effectiveness.
Building on the health action plan’s commitment to public reporting, the Government of Canada will work with the provinces and territories to create a citizens’ council on health care quality. This council will ensure that the public’s perspective is considered in developing meaningful indicators of health system performance.
As public reporting begins on how the health system is meeting the needs of Canadians, governments will use this information to continue to move forward with the renewal of medicare.
A Clean Environment
Canada is blessed by the beauty of its vast landscape and the wealth of its natural resources. But with this blessing comes the responsibility to ensure its preservation. A healthy environment is an essential part of a sustainable economy and our quality of life.
The Government’s focus will be on the three priorities of clean air, clean water, and the conservation of Canada’s natural spaces.
Last December, the Government of Canada signed an agreement with the United States to significantly reduce the emissions that cause smog. This agreement will lead to a 90 percent reduction in smog-causing vehicle emissions by 2010, bringing cleaner air to millions of citizens in both countries. The Government will move quickly to implement this agreement and other measures, working with the provinces and territories to achieve cleaner air. 
It is Canada’s responsibility, as steward of one of the world’s largest supplies of fresh water, to protect this critical resource. Safeguarding our water is a shared task among governments, industry and individual Canadians. The Government of Canada will fulfil its direct responsibilities for water, including the safety of water supplies on reserves and federal lands.
    The Government will also lead in developing stronger national guidelines for water quality by enhancing scientific research and continuing its collaboration with partners. Drawing on expertise within the Government and from across Canada, it will significantly strengthen the role of the National Water Research Institute.
    It will fund improvements to municipal water and waste water systems through the federal-provincial-municipal Infrastructure Canada program.
    It will also invest in research and development and advanced information systems to enable better land use and protect surface and ground water supplies from the impact of industrial and agricultural operations.
Canadians are the guardians of a significant percentage of the world’s wilderness and wildlife. The Government will invest in the creation of new national parks and implement a plan to restore existing parks to ecological health. It will work with its partners toward more integrated, sustainable management of Canada’s oceans. And it will re-introduce legislation for marine conservation areas and to protect species at risk.
As part of its efforts to promote global sustainable development, the Government will ensure that Canada does its part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will work with its provincial and territorial partners to implement the recently announced first national business plan on climate change.
To safeguard Canadians from toxic substances and environmental contaminants, the Government will also strengthen laws, research efforts and other measures for health protection. This will include the development of appropriate standards that reflect the special vulnerabilities of children.
Strong and Safe Communities
Strong and safe communities are an essential part of the fabric of our society. They are critical to providing Canadians with the security to build a better future for themselves and their families. They are also important to attracting talented people from around the world to come and make their home here.
Canadian communities of all sizes — whether urban or rural, Aboriginal or multicultural — face diverse challenges and have unique needs. The Government of Canada will strive to ensure that, wherever possible, its actions and programs are co-ordinated to help build local solutions to local challenges. It will work with partners across Canada to launch a dialogue on the opportunities and challenges facing urban centres. It will co-operate with provincial and municipal partners to help improve public transit infrastructure. And it will help to stimulate the creation of more affordable rental housing.
Ensuring that Canada’s communities are safe is an important element of fostering and attracting the talented people needed for success in the new economy. Crime rates in Canada have fallen steadily for almost a decade.
The Government of Canada will continue to work with provinces and territories, communities, and all its partners to implement a balanced approach to addressing crime — focussing on prevention as much as punishment, strengthening penalties for serious crime, and considering the needs of victims.
The Government will focus on safeguarding Canadians from new and emerging forms of crime. It will take aggressive steps to combat organized crime, including the creation of stronger anti-gang laws and measures to protect members of the justice system from intimidation. It will provide enhanced law enforcement tools to deal with emerging threats to security, such as cybercrime and terrorism. It will act to safeguard children from crime, including criminals on the Internet. The Government will take steps to ensure that our laws protect children from those who would prey on their vulnerability.
The Government will re-introduce legislation to change how the justice system deals with young offenders. It will encourage alternatives to custody for non-violent offenders, emphasizing rehabilitation and re-integration into society, while toughening consequences for more violent youth.
Working with the provinces, territories and communities, the Government of Canada will strengthen the capacity of local communities to deal with conflict, prevent crime, and address drug abuse.
It is a tragic reality that too many Aboriginal people are finding themselves in conflict with the law. Canada must take the measures needed to significantly reduce the percentage of Aboriginal people entering the criminal justice system, so that within a generation it is no higher than the Canadian average.
 
Vibrant Canadian Culture
 
Canada is defined by far more than its political boundaries or economic relationships. In these times of rapid change and globalization, it is more important than ever that we know who we are as Canadians and what brings us together.
The focus of our cultural policies for the future must be on excellence in the creative process, diverse Canadian content, and access to the arts and heritage for all Canadians.
Both the English and French networks of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation have long been cornerstones of Canadian cultural policy. The CBC helps connect Canadians to each other, their history and their country. It reaches all parts of Canada, from big cities to small towns to Northern and Aboriginal communities. It provides a distinctive Canadian voice in both official languages and important opportunities for our creative people. The Government will increase its support to help the CBC fulfil its distinct role as a public broadcaster serving all Canadians.
The Government will assist the book-publishing and sound-recording sectors to make the transition to the new economy. It will continue to support the development of digital content for the Internet and other new media in French and English. And it will work to expand international markets for Canadian cultural products and services.
Communities across Canada are increasingly recognizing the importance of arts and heritage for their quality of life and ability to attract talent, investment and tourism. The Government of Canada will continue to work with the private and not-for-profit sectors and other governments to strengthen Canada’s cultural infrastructure. It will help communities to develop arts and heritage programs that are sustainable and relevant to their diverse circumstances and aspirations.
Creating and Sharing Opportunities Globally
The well-being of Canada and Canadians depends on global human security, prosperity and development.
The Government of Canada is committed to working with its international partners to promote international peace and security by enhancing the mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution. It will work to strengthen global governance as well as existing and new multilateral institutions. These include the G-20 — a new forum of which Canada is the first chair — which is striving to enhance the stability of the world economy and ensure that globalization benefits all its participants.
The Government will increase Canada’s official development assistance and use these new investments to advance efforts to reduce international poverty and to strengthen democracy, justice and social stability worldwide.
Canadians have become leaders in harnessing the power of technology to build a more inclusive society. This experience serves as a powerful model for the world. Through its participation on the Digital Opportunities Task Force established by the G-8 nations and through its own investments in developing countries, Canada will contribute to closing the global digital divide.
The Government will continue Canada’s proud record of peacekeeping. In Budget 2000, the Government provided funding increases for the Canadian Forces to help ensure that they are equipped and prepared to respond quickly to calls for help at home and abroad.
The Summit of the Americas this year presents an exceptional opportunity to promote a balanced and coherent vision for deepening co-operation among the nations of the Western hemisphere. The summit declaration and action plan will support Canada’s interest in strengthening democracy and human rights, expanding commerce through the Free Trade Area of the Americas initiative, increasing people’s access to the benefits of growth, and providing opportunities for all nations in the Americas to improve the quality of life of their citizens.
At the Summit of the Americas and as chair of the G-8 in 2002, Canada will work to expand opportunities for more countries to participate in the benefits of globalization, while pressing for peace and security in the world.
Celebrating Our Canadian Citizenship
Canada was born of a noble vision and an act of will.
Our Canadian citizenship has been built over time through the experiences we have shared . . .
. . . when together we celebrate the successes of our scientists, scholars, athletes and artists, our leaders on the world stage, and our peacekeepers. And when we remember and honour our war veterans.
. . . when we visit other parts of our country or when we travel abroad and see ourselves through the eyes of others.
. . . when every year thousands of new Canadians stand proudly with their families to take on the responsibilities of Canadian citizenship.
. . . when we come together to help each other in tough times. And when millions of Canadians volunteer their time and energy to make their communities a better place.
The Government will help Canadians to strengthen their bonds of mutual understanding and respect, to celebrate their achievements and history, and to exercise their shared citizenship.
    It will continue to expand exchange programs for young Canadians to reach its goal of 100,000 exchanges each year.
    Canada’s linguistic duality is fundamental to our Canadian identity and is a key element of our vibrant society. The protection and promotion of our two official languages is a priority of the Government — from coast to coast. The Government reaffirms its commitment to support sustainable official language minority communities and a strong French culture and language. And it will mobilize its efforts to ensure that all Canadians can interact with the Government of Canada in either official language.
The institutions of Government will continue to be strengthened. Since 1993, the Government has taken a range of measures to enable members of Parliament to more effectively represent the views of their constituents. MPs have participated in pre-budget consultations, at the end of which recommendations were made to the Government. Moreover, private members’ bills from the House and Senate have been taken into account more often and considered with greater attention than at any time in the past.
In this new session of Parliament, the Government will make further proposals to improve procedures in the House and Senate. Among other measures, voting procedures will be modernized in the House of Commons and, to assist parliamentarians in carrying out their duties, the Government intends to increase the resources of the Library of Parliament to better serve the research needs of standing committees of the House and Senate.
Every Canadian is called upon to make a contribution to building our country. To ensure that the promise of Canada becomes an even greater reality in the 21st century. And to ensure that our Canadian Way remains the best example of what is possible when women and men of every race and creed come together in community in search of a better future.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate and
Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
41,37,2,2002-09-30,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
It is a pleasure to greet you in the Jubilee Year of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, whom we will be welcoming to Canada very shortly.
We also mark this year the 50th anniversary of Canadian Governors General. To celebrate this, we invited to Rideau Hall an energetic group of one hundred 17- and 18-year-olds from every province and territory to participate in a Youth Forum on creating community. In Gaspé, in Nunavut, on Haida Gwaii, all across the country, we are meeting young people who are becoming catalysts for change, as they take their place as leaders in the fields they choose.
It is exciting and encouraging to hear what young people are saying and what they are doing. Already, they are innovative. They are diverse. And they will change things. Some of them will do so through journalism, the arts, business or the labour movement. Others will devote themselves to civic and public life, perhaps becoming in time your successors, to carry on the democratic traditions of Parliament to which you are committing your lives. Nothing is more precious and valuable than our way of creating a society through the exercise of our democratic rights as citizens.
And the sacrifices that some of our citizens make are deeply appreciated by their country. My trip in April to Germany, where our fallen and injured were brought from the tragic incident in Afghanistan, was emotionally shared by all Canadians, many of whom have expressed how much the sacrifice of these men has meant to them.
This kind of contribution, this kind of democratic participation, this kind of nurturing of young leadership make us what we are as a nation. It is a very precious life that we share as Canadians. And we must be prepared not only to praise it, but also to make sacrifices for it.
Canadians today are confident about their personal prospects and Canada’s future. Less than ten years ago, our economy was in decline, our deficit and debt were rising out of control, our unity was under threat, our confidence was shaken.
Today, because of our collective efforts, we have new opportunities, new possibilities and new choices for the Canada we want.
We have established the foundations for great success: fiscal sovereignty, a unified country and a confident people. We will not put at risk the accomplishments of the last decade. We will continue to be prudent and live within our means.
Maintaining our fiscal sovereignty and a dynamic economy allows us to reach higher. To find new solutions to enduring problems. To set new goals and ambitious targets. To take responsibility for building the Canada we want, for ourselves and for future generations.
We now have a generation of Canadians who have grown up in the Internet world, a generation of Canadians who are global, at ease with change and diversity, optimistic and eager to create, innovate and excel. And who believe they can achieve their aspirations in Canada. Canada must tap into and unleash this energy.
The goal of the government is nothing less than making Canada a land of ever-widening opportunity. Ensuring that the benefits of the new economy touch every community and lift every family and every Canadian.
Working together, we can put in place the health care system for the 21st century. We can get Canada’s children off welfare. We can close the gap in life chances between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians. We can tackle the challenge of climate change. We can be a world leader in innovation and learning, a magnet for talent and investment. We can build world-class cities and healthy communities. We can strengthen the bonds of shared citizenship and the partnership between government and Canadians. We can secure our place in North America and in the world as a mature country, confident in who we are and where we are headed.
This is the time for Canada.
Canada and the World
We live in uncertain times. The events of September 11 demonstrated that our progress at home can be affected in a moment by world events. We see unrest in many parts of the world. We still see far too much poverty.
The government will continue to work with its allies to ensure the safety and security of Canadians. Canada will continue to work through organizations such as the United Nations to ensure that the rule of international law is respected and enforced. At the same time, the government will remain vigilant and ready to ensure the protection of Canadians from emerging threats, and will work with the United States to address our shared security needs.
But there is more we can do. Canada has a long history of contributing solutions to global problems. We will continue to speak out in every forum for the values of pluralism, freedom and democracy, and contribute to reducing the growing global divide between rich and poor. We will double our development assistance by the year 2010, and earmark at least half of that increase for Africa as part of Canada’s support for the New Partnership for Africa’s Development. As of January 1, 2003, Canada will eliminate tariffs and quotas on almost all products from the least-developed countries.
In the face of rapid change and uncertainty, the government must engage Canadians in a discussion about the role that Canada will play in the world. Before the end of this mandate, the government will set out a long-term direction on international and defence policy that reflects our values and interests and ensures that Canada’s military is equipped to fulfill the demands placed upon it.
Putting in Place the Health Care System for 21st Century
No issue touches Canadians more deeply than health care. Our health care system is a practical expression of the values that define us as a country. Of the willingness of Canadians to share risk and accept responsibility for one another.
In 2000, all First Ministers reached an agreement on health care that reinforced our collective commitment to the principles of medicare, to working collaboratively to reform our system and to measure and report on our progress. Resources were provided. Work is proceeding. And the first public report is now available.
Building on this work, Roy Romanow was appointed to lead a commission on the longer-term future of Canada’s publicly funded health care system. He will report in November.
The Prime Minister will convene a First Ministers Meeting early in 2003 to put in place a comprehensive plan for reform, including enhanced accountability to Canadians and the necessary federal long-term investments, which will be included in the next budget.
At the same time, the government will move ahead with an action plan in health policy areas under its direct responsibility. Under this plan, it will renew federal health protection legislation to better address emerging risks, adapt to modern technology and emphasize prevention. The government will take steps to strengthen the security of Canada’s food system and reintroduce pesticides legislation to protect the health of Canadians, particularly children. It will work with its partners to develop a national strategy for healthy living, physical activity and sport, and will convene the first ever national summit on these issues in 2003. The government will take further action to close the gap in health status between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians by putting in place a First Nations Health Promotion and Disease Prevention strategy with a targeted immunization program, and by working with its partners to improve health care delivery on-reserve.
The government will also modify existing programs to ensure that Canadians can provide compassionate care for a gravely ill or dying child, parent or spouse without putting their jobs or incomes at risk.
Helping Children and Families out of Poverty
Five years ago, Canada’s governments launched the National Children’s Agenda, engaging Canadians in every part of the country on how to ensure that all Canadian children have a good start in life; that families with children have the tools they need to provide care and nurturing.
No investments have greater payoff. No investments do more to break the cycle of poverty and dependency, and to maximize the potential of every Canadian.
The government will put in place a long-term investment plan to allow poor families to break out of the welfare trap so that children born into poverty do not carry the consequences of that poverty throughout their lives. It will again significantly increase the National Child Benefit for poor families, and will work with its partners to increase access to early learning opportunities and to quality child care, particularly for poor and lone-parent families. It will also put in place targeted measures for low-income families caring for severely disabled children, to help meet the needs of the child and of the family.
The government will take additional measures to address the gap in life chances between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. It will put in place early childhood development programs for First Nations, expanding Aboriginal Headstart, improving parental supports and providing Aboriginal communities with the tools to address fetal alcohol syndrome and its effects. The most enduring contribution Canada can make to First Nations is to raise the standard of education on-reserve. The government will work with the recently created National Working Group on Education to improve educational outcomes for First Nations children, and take immediate steps to help First Nations children with special learning needs.
Parents have the primary responsibility for providing their children with the tools to learn and develop. But Canadians also have a collective responsibility to protect Canada’s children from exploitation in all its forms, and from the consequences of family breakdown.
The government will therefore reform the Criminal Code to increase the penalties for abuse and neglect, and provide more sensitive treatment for children who take part in justice proceedings as victims or as witnesses. It will also reform family law, putting greater emphasis on the best interests of the child; expand the Unified Family Courts; and ensure that appropriate child and family services are available.
The Challenge of Climate Change and the Environment
Canadians know that our health and the health of our children, the quality of life in our communities and our continued economic prosperity depend on a healthy environment.
On a global scale, the problem of climate change is creating new health and environmental risks and threatens to become the defining challenge for generations to come.
As a northern country, Canadians will feel some of the effects of climate change sooner than will others. As a prosperous country, we must and will do our part.
As part of the Kyoto Protocol, Canada agreed to obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2012. Extensive consultations and preparatory work followed. The government is now intensifying consultations with Canadians, industry and provinces to develop an implementation strategy to meet Canada’s obligations over the next ten years. Before the end of this year, the government will bring forward a resolution to Parliament on the issue of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change. Meeting this challenge must become a national project, calling upon the efforts and contributions of all Canadians, in all regions and sectors of the economy—producers and consumers, governments and citizens.
To conserve our wilderness areas, clean water sources and key habitat, the government will create ten new national parks and five new National Marine Conservation Areas over the next five years. It will improve the ecological integrity in Canada’s existing national parks. It will reintroduce legislation to protect species at risk.
The government will accelerate the clean-up of federal contaminated sites in Canada. It will work with the United States to further improve air quality. It will accelerate its work with the provinces on improved national water quality guidelines, and ensure their implementation in areas of federal jurisdiction.
A Magnet for Talent and Investment
The Canada we want requires a strong economy. The government will maintain its unwavering commitment to balanced budgets, disciplined spending, a declining ratio of debt-to-GDP, and fair and competitive taxes. It will build on its investments in research, literacy and education, and in competitive cities and healthy communities. It will also adjust its policies to enhance the climate for investment and talent. The government will reallocate resources to the highest priorities and transform old spending to new purposes.
Skills, Learning and Research
The fuel of the new economy is knowledge. The government has invested heavily in providing Canada’s schools and libraries with the information technology to connect young Canadians with the best information and knowledge the world has to offer. It has invested in access to universities and in excellence in university research because Canada’s youth need and deserve the best education possible, and Canada needs universities that produce the best knowledge and the best graduates.
The government will build on these investments. It will continue to increase its funding to the federal granting councils to provide young Canadians greater support for graduate studies and research. It will work with universities on the indirect costs of research and on strategies for its commercialization to create opportunities for entrepreneurs and to fuel innovation. It will continue to work with small- and medium-sized enterprises in the development and application of new technologies in traditional and emerging sectors.
It will strengthen government science, integrating its efforts across departments and disciplines, and focussing on the priorities of Canadians.
In November, the Government of Canada will host the National Summit on Innovation and Learning. This will be an opportunity to position Canada as a world leader in such areas as health sciences, biotechnology and clean energy.
The economy of the 21st century will need workers who are lifelong learners, who can respond and adapt to change. Canada’s labour market programs must be transformed to meet this challenge. To this end, the government will work with Canadians, provinces, sector councils, labour organizations and learning institutions to create the skills and learning architecture that Canada needs, and to promote workplace learning. This will include building our knowledge and reporting to Canadians about what is working and what is not.
The Youth Employment Strategy has been successful in increasing job opportunities and experience for young Canadians. But the employment needs of our youth are changing. Government strategies have to keep pace. Working with youth and other partners, the government will redirect its resources in this area to develop skills for the future and to help those who face the greatest barriers to employment. It will also work with the provinces to fast-track a comprehensive agreement to remove barriers to participation in work and learning for persons with disabilities.
The government will promote entrepreneurial skills and job creation among Aboriginal people by increasing support for Aboriginal Business Canada. It will also tailor and target its training programs to help Aboriginal and Inuit people participate in economic opportunities such as the development of Voisey Bay, northern gas pipelines and similar projects throughout Canada.
One of Canada’s greatest assets—and a unique advantage in a globalized world—is our openness to immigrants from every corner of the globe. The demographic realities of an aging population and slowing labour force growth place an even greater premium on this immigration advantage. Canada must continue to be the country that immigrants choose to find hope, hospitality and opportunity.
The government will work with its partners to break down the barriers to the recognition of foreign credentials and will fast-track skilled workers entering Canada with jobs already waiting for them. It will also position Canada as a destination of choice for talented foreign students and skilled workers by more aggressively selecting and recruiting through universities and in key embassies abroad.
Smart Regulation
The knowledge economy requires new approaches to how we regulate. We need regulation to achieve the public good, and we need to regulate in a way that enhances the climate for investment and trust in the markets. The government will move forward with a smart regulation strategy to accelerate reforms in key areas to promote health and sustainability, to contribute to innovation and economic growth, and to reduce the administrative burden on business.
As part of this strategy, the government will adapt its intellectual property framework to enable Canada to be a world leader on emerging issues such as new life forms. It will speed up the regulatory process for drug approvals to ensure that Canadians have faster access to the safe drugs they need, creating a better climate for research in pharmaceuticals. It will work with provinces to implement a national system for the governance of research involving humans, including national research ethics and standards.
The government will revise Canadian copyright rules to ensure that Canada has a progressive regime that supports increased investment in knowledge and cultural works.
It will reintroduce legislation to amend the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. It will also streamline environmental assessment processes, including implementing a single window for projects such as the northern pipeline. To pursue its strategy over the longer-term, the government will create an External Advisory Committee on Smart Regulation to recommend areas where government needs to redesign its regulatory approach to create and maintain a Canadian advantage.
The government will implement the recently announced Agricultural Policy Framework and related measures to promote innovation in that key sector, which is vital to rural Canada and all Canadians.
The Canada-US Smart Border Declaration contributes to both our national security and the free flow of people, goods and commerce across our shared border. The government will build on this work and increase its consular presence to expand fair and secure trade and commerce, and to brand Canada in the United States. It will continue to work bilaterally and multilaterally to resolve trade disputes over softwood lumber and agriculture.
Recent events in the United States have weakened confidence in capital markets, not only in that country, but around the world. The government has been working closely with all parties to bolster investor confidence and improve the efficiency and integrity of Canadian capital markets. In this regard, it will review and, where necessary, change its laws and strengthen enforcement to ensure that governance standards for federally incorporated companies and financial institutions remain of the highest order.
Many investors and businesses have expressed concern that Canada’s fragmented securities regulatory structure is inadequate and an obstacle to growth. They have urged reform to ensure that businesses can efficiently access the financing they need to grow, and to assure Canadians that they will be treated fairly when they invest. Co-operation among governments will be necessary. The government will work with all participants to ensure that Canada has the modern and efficient securities regulatory system it needs.
Competitive Cities and Healthy Communities
Competitive cities and healthy communities are vital to our individual and national well-being, and to Canada’s ability to attract and retain talent and investment. They require not only strong industries, but also safe neighbourhoods; not only a dynamic labour force, but access to a rich and diverse cultural life. They require new partnerships, a new urban strategy, a new approach to healthy communities for the 21st century.
Modern infrastructure is key to the prosperity of our cities and the health of our communities. Working with provinces and municipalities, the government will put in place a ten-year program for infrastructure to accommodate long-term strategic initiatives essential to competitiveness and sustainable growth. Within this framework, it will introduce a new strategy for a safe, efficient and environmentally responsible transportation system that will help reduce congestion in our cities and bottlenecks in our trade corridors.
It will extend its investments in affordable housing for those whose needs are greatest, particularly in those Canadians cities where the problem is most acute. It will extend the Supporting Communities Partnership Initiative to provide communities with the tools to plan and implement local strategies to help reduce homelessness.
In a number of cities, poverty is disproportionately concentrated among Aboriginal people. The government will work with interested provinces to expand on existing pilot programs to meet the needs of Aboriginal people living in cities.
The government will target its regional development activities to better meet the needs of the knowledge economy and address the distinct challenges of Canada’s urban, rural and northern communities.
The government will work with Canada’s largest cities to develop targeted strategies to reduce the barriers faced by new immigrants in settling into the social and economic life of their new communities. It will introduce targeted measures to help children of recent immigrants to learn French and English, so that they can realize the opportunities that brought their parents to this country.
The government will also implement a national drug strategy to address addiction while promoting public safety. It will expand the number of drug treatment courts. It will act on the results of parliamentary consultations with Canadians on options for change in our drug laws, including the possibility of the decriminalization of marijuana possession.
A New Partnership Between Government and Citizens
Canada has a unique model of citizenship, based simultaneously on diversity and mutual responsibility. This model requires deliberate efforts to connect Canadians across their differences, to link them to their history and to enable their diverse voices to participate in choosing the Canada we want.
The government will ensure that as Canadians take charge of their future, they will have access to their history by creating a new institution that brings together the National Archives of Canada and the National Library of Canada, providing new tools to reach Canadians, young and old. It will also strengthen key arts and heritage institutions and protect significant historic sites and buildings.
It will create more opportunities for young Canadians to help clean up our environment and assist in achieving Canada’s global priorities, particularly in Africa.
It will reform our citizenship legislation to reassert the rights and reinforce the responsibilities that go with being Canadian.
It will put into action the accord it signed with the voluntary sector last December, to enable the sector to contribute to national priorities and represent the views of those too often excluded.
The government will work with provinces toward renewal of legal aid so that Canadians can have access to adequate legal representation before the courts.
Linguistic duality is at the heart of our collective identity. The government will implement an action plan on official languages that will focus on minority-language and second-language education, including the goal of doubling within ten years the number of high school graduates with a working knowledge of both English and French. It will support the development of minority English- and French-speaking communities, and expand access to services in their language in areas such as health. It will enhance the use of our two official languages in the federal public service, both in the workplace and when communicating with Canadians.
The government will reintroduce legislation to strengthen First Nations governance institutions—to support democratic principles, transparency and public accountability, and provide the tools to improve the quality of public administration in First Nations communities. It will work with these communities to build their capacity for economic and social development, and it will expand community-based justice approaches, particularly for youth living on reserves and Aboriginals in the North. The government will also work with Aboriginal people to preserve and enhance Aboriginal languages and cultures.
Canadians want their government to be open, accountable and responsive to their diverse and changing needs.
Early in this session, the government will provide clear guidance and better enforcement of the ethical standards expected of elected officials and senior public servants. The government will strengthen the legislation governing its relationship with lobbyists. And the government will introduce legislative changes to the financing of political parties and candidates for office.
Canadians know the value and importance of the role of government and of the need for excellence in the public service. The government will introduce long-awaited reforms for the public service to ensure that it can attract the diverse talent it needs to continue to serve Canadians well.
Conclusion
The Canada we want cannot happen by government acting alone or by citizens acting apart.
We know that by pursuing the common good, we pursue our own good; that a country is more than a collection of narrow interests, it is a common enterprise to which all can contribute.
The priorities we have outlined today build on the conviction that we must add to the work of our ancestors, and leave Canada a better place for future generations.
May our future, like our past, be a story of achievement.
Fellow Canadians:
Respectful of our history, confident in our future, let each of us do our part.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate and
Members of the House of Commons:
As you carry out your duties and exercise your responsibilities, may you be guided by Divine Providence."
42,37,3,2004-02-02,liberal,"Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am pleased to greet you at the beginning of 2004, when, as Canadians, we know that our history and our capacity for change are a part of our strength as a complex and modern country. Human dignity and respect for others and a realistic awareness of our past make us a mature nation and help us to move forward to express our true values.
We have our Canadian values and we can bring them into the international sphere in a humanitarian and effective way. As Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces, I have the privilege of seeing our values as Canadians in action.
When I visited our troops in Kabul, I could see that our troops play a vital role of courage and commitment. In the past year, we have suffered tragic loss and injury to our soldiers while carrying out Canada’s commitment to peace. I said to the soldiers that every single one of them carries within him or her a microcosm of our Canadian character. A desire to create a world where fairness, justice and decency reign.
That part of the Canadian character comes out in civilian ways when we face natural disasters—such as the devastation of the fires in British Columbia or the destruction of Hurricane Juan on our eastern coast. My visit to Kelowna and Kamloops after the devastating fires confirmed to me that Canadians, even in distress and loss, think of others. Many assured me that their situations were not as bad as their neighbours’ and were more concerned about how others would cope.
It is this ability to look at the needs of others, to feel compassion for their suffering as part of our own, which speaks to the best of us as Canadians. I think this comes from the fact that we have a society that is caring, in which Aboriginals, Francophones, Anglophones—and immigrants from all over the world—play a significant part. Our history has prepared us to be innovative in the modern world, where diversity counts for so much.
I preside over citizenship ceremonies across this country whenever I can, most recently in Saskatoon 10 days ago. But whether it’s in Saint John, Quebec City, Ottawa, Calgary, I speak to our newest Canadians with optimism. Because I know that, as they look around them, they will see examples of what it is like to live the truly Canadian life, to accept and be accepted, to understand and be understood.
When we look around us at Canada today, we see many strengths, many achievements—a society with an enviable quality of life and so much potential, so much talent.
We can build on these strengths to expand our horizons and enlarge our ambitions.
Canadians have already taken up that challenge. They have embraced change with a new confidence. Canadians know who they are and what they want. They want a government that helps shape that course, that leads the way—and that also engages them in building the future.
We want governments to reflect our values in the actions they take. This includes living within our means; investing as we can afford; and looking to the future.
Canadians want their government to do more than just settle for the status quo. They want a government that can lead change, develop a national consensus on common goals and have the wisdom to help all of us achieve them.
The goals of the Government of Canada are clear.
We want a Canada with strong social foundations, where people are treated with dignity, where they are given a hand when needed, where no one is left behind. Where Canadians—families and communities—have the tools to find local solutions for local problems.
We want a strong economy for the 21st century, with well-paying and meaningful work; ready at the forefront of the next big technological revolution; and built on a solid fiscal foundation.
We want for Canada a role of pride and influence in the world, where we speak with an independent voice, bringing distinctive Canadian values to international affairs. It is time to take our place, meet our responsibilities, carry our weight.
Today the Government is proposing an ambitious agenda to set our country on this path. An agenda that should be measured and judged by the goals we have set and by the resolve and constancy by which they are pursued.
Achievements of worth and permanence take time. But that is no excuse for inaction. The Government is committed to making the down payments needed now and to build consistently on these steps as resources permit. So that, a decade hence, we will see that today we made the right choices for the country.
This Speech from the Throne marks the start of a new government; a new agenda; a new way of working.
It marks a renewal, built on partnership, opportunity, achievement—and the real engagement of Canadians.
Changing the way things work in Ottawa
The path to achievement begins with making sure that Canadians believe their government, so that they can believe in government.
We must re-engage citizens in Canada’s political life. And this has to begin in the place where it should mean the most—in Parliament—by making Parliament work better. That means reconnecting citizens with their Members of Parliament.
That means a new partnership with provinces and territories, focused on the interests of Canadians. That also means greater transparency, ethical standards, and financial accountability in how we govern.
The Government of Canada is determined to return Parliament to the centre of national debate and decision making and to restore the public’s faith and trust in the integrity and good management of government.
To that end, it will, as a first step, immediately table in Parliament an action plan for democratic reform.
This will include significantly more free votes, so that Members can represent the views of their constituents as they see fit.
This will include an enhanced role for Members to shape laws.
An enhanced role for Parliamentary Committees, so that Members can hold the Government to greater account—and can play a key role in reviewing senior appointments.
A more active role for Parliamentary Secretaries, for greater engagement between the Government and Parliament and with Canadians.
Significantly enhancing the role of all MPs will make Parliament what it was intended to be—a place where Canadians can see and hear their views debated and their interests heard. In short, a place where they can have an influence on the policies that affect their lives.
Restoring trust and accountability
Democratic renewal must also restore trust. Too many Canadians are alienated from their governments. This must be reversed.
Canadians want the Government of Canada to do better in meeting ethical standards. That is why, as one of its first acts, the Government enhanced the ethics code for all federal public office holders. And that is also why the Government will ask Parliament to immediately reinstate and adopt legislation establishing an independent Ethics Commissioner reporting to Parliament and an Ethics Officer for the Senate.
And this is why the Government created a new agency for continuing excellence in public service. A professional, non-partisan public service—drawing on the talents and commitment of Canadians from every region—is a source of strength and advantage. Our public servants have an important role in this agenda of change. They want to improve how we govern. Canadians deserve the best public service possible—and our agenda demands it.
Democratic renewal means that government programs deliver on objectives, that they deliver what matters in people’s lives. Canadians expect government to respect their tax dollars. They want to have the confidence that public money—their money—is wisely spent.
To this end, the Government is launching an ongoing process of expenditure review, overseen by a new Committee of Cabinet. This will ensure that spending reflects priorities and that every tax dollar is invested with care to achieve results for Canadians.
A stronger relationship
Democratic renewal means opening the doors in Ottawa to the voices of our provinces and territories—all our regions—and adopting new ways of working together on behalf of Canadians.
Jurisdiction must be respected. But Canadians do not go about their daily lives worried about which jurisdiction does this or that. They expect, rightly, that their governments will co-operate in common purpose for the common good—each working from its strength. They expect them to just get on with the job.
That is why the Government is determined to put relations with provinces and territories on a more constructive footing.
Strengthening Canada’s social foundations
Changing the way things work in Government will help all Canadians to achieve their goals, starting with strengthening Canada’s social foundations.
That means ensuring that all Canadians have the opportunity to develop and use skills and knowledge to their fullest. It means removing barriers to opportunity. It means building on the fundamental fairness of Canadians. Because our enormous good fortune demands nothing less.
This philosophy is given concrete expression in our system of universal health care; in social programs that seek to level the playing field for everyone; in programs to provide our seniors with income assistance and care when needed; in our openness to immigrants and refugees and abhorrence of racism; in our commitment to gender equality; in measures to better the opportunities for Aboriginal Canadians.
Partnership for a healthy Canada
The Government’s commitment to health care rests on one fundamental tenet: that every Canadian have timely access to quality care, regardless of income or geography—access when they need it.
The Government is committed to this goal: universal, high-quality, publicly funded health care, consistent with the principles of medicare, as set out in the Canada Health Act.
The length of waiting times for the most important diagnoses and treatments is a litmus test of our health care system. These waiting times must be reduced.
This will require fundamental reform and improvement in the facilities and procedures of the entire health care system.
But there is much we can do right now.
The Prime Minister announced on Friday that the Government of Canada has determined that, without going into deficit, it will now be able to provide a further $2 billion health-care transfer to the provinces and territories this year. Funds to help reduce waiting times; to improve access to diagnostic services; to provide for more doctors and more nurses.
Looking forward, the Government will work with its provincial and territorial partners on the necessary reforms and long-term sustainability of the health system. And it will support the Health Council in the development of information on which waiting-time objectives can be set, and by which Canadians can judge progress toward them.
Canadians also want to be protected from emerging threats to their health, from global epidemics to contaminated water. Safeguarding the health of Canadians is a top priority of this Government.
The shock of SARS demonstrated vividly our vulnerability to infectious diseases that may be incubated anywhere on earth.
Diseases such as SARS and the recent avian flu pose threats which increased global mobility can only make worse.
The Government will therefore take the lead in establishing a strong and responsive public health system, starting with a new Canada Public Health Agency that will ensure that Canada is linked, both nationally and globally, in a network for disease control and emergency response.
The Government will also appoint a new Chief Public Health Officer for Canada—and undertake a much-needed overhaul of federal health protection through a Canada Health Protection Act.
Strengthening our social foundations also means improving the overall health of Canadians—starting with health promotion to help reduce the incidence of avoidable disease. The Government will work with all of its partners to that end, following the age-old prescription that prevention is the best cure.
Caring for our children
The future of our children is, quite literally, Canada’s future.
Science teaches that the early years can shape—or limit—one’s future, that early and effective intervention can have enduring benefits.
Governments are not parents, but they do have a role to play in helping to make sure that families get the supports and tools that they need and in protecting children from exploitation and abuse.
We must ensure that every child gets the best possible start in life; that all of Canada’s children enter school ready to learn; that we protect their health, their happiness, and their freedom to grow in mind and in body without fear. These are the foundations of healthy early childhood development.
That is the goal. And there are important steps we can take now—down payments on an enduring commitment.
First, in co-operation with the provinces and territories, the Government will accelerate initiatives under the existing Multilateral Framework for Early Learning and Child Care, which means more quality child care more quickly.
Second, to help communities identify children whose readiness to learn is at risk, the Government will extend its successful community pilot project, Understanding the Early Years, to at least 100 communities. Communities themselves can do much for their children with the right knowledge and tools.
Third, the Government will do more to ensure the safety of children through a strategy to counter sexual exploitation of children on the Internet and by reinstating child protection legislation.
Creating opportunity for Canadians with disabilities
Many Canadians with disabilities are ready to contribute but confront difficult obstacles in the workplace and in their communities. And too often, families are left on their own to care for a severely disabled relative. Here too, the Government of Canada has a role.
We want a Canada in which citizens with disabilities have the opportunity to contribute to and benefit from Canada’s prosperity—as learners, workers, volunteers, and family members.
Canada cannot afford to squander the talents of people with disabilities or turn its back on those who seek to provide care and a life of dignity for family members with severe disabilities.
The Government will start by working with the provinces and territories to fill the gaps in education and skills development and in workplace supports and workplace accommodation for people with disabilities.
It will lead by example in supporting the hiring, accommodation and retention of Canadians with disabilities in the Government of Canada—the nation’s largest employer—and in federally regulated industries.
The Government will also improve the fairness of the tax system for people with disabilities, and their supporting families, based on the findings of the Advisory Committee on Tax Measures, which will report this fall and will implement early actions in areas of priority.
Aboriginal Canadians
Aboriginal Canadians have not fully shared in our nation’s good fortune. While some progress has been made, the conditions in far too many Aboriginal communities can only be described as shameful. This offends our values. It is in our collective interest to turn the corner. And we must start now.
Our goal is to see Aboriginal children get a better start in life as a foundation for greater progress in acquiring the education and work-force skills needed to succeed.
Our goal is to see real economic opportunities for Aboriginal individuals and communities.
To see Aboriginal Canadians participating fully in national life, on the basis of historic rights and agreements—with greater economic self-reliance, a better quality of life.
The Government of Canada will work with First Nations to improve governance in their communities—to enhance transparency and accountability—because this is the prerequisite to effective self-government and economic development. Aboriginal leadership is committed to this end and rapid progress is essential.
In order to support governance capacity in Aboriginal communities and to enhance effective dialogue, the Government will, in co-operation with First Nations, establish an independent Centre for First Nations Government.
The Government will also focus on education and skills development, because this is a prerequisite to individual opportunity and full participation. To pursue this goal, the Government will work with provinces and territories and Aboriginal partners in a renewed Aboriginal Human Resources Development Strategy.
Too often, the needs of Aboriginal people off reserve are caught up in jurisdictional wrangling. These issues cannot deter us. The Government of Canada will work with its partners on practical solutions to help Aboriginal people respond to the unique challenges they face. To this end, the Government will expand the successful Urban Aboriginal Strategy with willing provinces and municipalities.
The Government will also engage other levels of government and Métis leadership on the place of the Métis in its policies.
The Government is committed to a more coherent approach to Aboriginal issues. To focus this effort, it has established a new Cabinet Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister; a Parliamentary Secretary; and an Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat in the Privy Council Office.
Great places to live—a new deal for communities
Our communities, our towns, our cities are key to our social goals and our economic competitiveness. Large and small, rural and urban, Canada’s communities are facing new challenges, often without sufficient resources or the tools they need.
Canada depends on communities that can attract the best talent and compete for investment as vibrant centres of commerce, learning, and culture. We want communities that provide affordable housing, good transit, quality health care, excellent schools, safe neighbourhoods, and abundant green spaces.
To this end, the Government of Canada is committed to a new deal for Canada’s municipalities.
A new deal that targets the infrastructure needed to support quality of life and sustainable growth.
A new deal that helps our communities become more dynamic, more culturally rich, more cohesive, and partners in strengthening Canada’s social foundations.
A new deal that delivers reliable, predictable and long-term funding.
Therefore, the Government will work with provinces to share with municipalities a portion of gas tax revenues or to determine other fiscal mechanisms which achieve the same goals.
This will take time and the agreement of other governments. But the Government of Canada is prepared now, as a down payment, to act in its own jurisdiction by providing all municipalities with full relief from the portion of the Goods and Services Tax they now pay.
Over the next decade, this will provide Canada’s municipalities with approximately $7 billion of stable new funding to help meet critical priorities.
The Government will also move to quickly commit funds within our existing infrastructure programs, so that our partners can plan properly.
Together, these are real and ongoing investments in urban transit, affordable housing, clean water, and good roads. Canada’s municipalities asked for this. The Government has acted.
Canada’s municipalities can play a crucial role in helping the Government meet its national priorities—for the integration of immigrants, for opportunities for Aboriginal Canadians living in urban centres, for tackling homelessness, and for emergency preparedness and response. The new deal means that city hall has a real seat at the table of national change.
And the Government will help communities to help themselves.
One of the best ways to do this is to get behind the remarkable people who are applying entrepreneurial skills, not for profit, but rather to enhance the social and environmental conditions in our communities right across Canada.
These new approaches to community development—sometimes referred to as the “social economy”—are producing more and more success stories about a turn around in individual lives and distressed neighbourhoods—communities working to combat homelessness, address poverty and clean up the environment.
The Government of Canada wants to support those engaged in this entrepreneurial social movement. It will increase their access to resources and tools. The Government will, for example, work to widen the scope of programs currently available to small and medium-sized enterprises to include social enterprises.
The voluntary sector and the millions of Canadian volunteers are essential contributors to the quality, fairness and vitality of our communities. The Government will continue to advance the Voluntary Sector Initiative, to strengthen the capacity and voice of philanthropic and charitable organizations and to mobilize volunteers.
Another defining characteristic of our communities and of our reputation around the world is the vitality and excellence of our cultural life. Canada’s artists and cultural enterprises are among our best ambassadors, as well as being an increasingly dynamic element of the knowledge economy. Their work holds a mirror on our society and builds a legacy for future generations.
The Government will work with parliamentarians to modernize our arts and culture policies and federal cultural institutions to bring to bear the new technological possibilities of the digital age and to reflect Canada’s regional diversity and multiculturalism.
Linguistic duality is at the heart of our identity. It is our image in the world. It opens doors for us.
The Government will nurture this asset, which benefits all Canadians. It will ensure that minority language communities have the tools that enable their members to fully contribute to the development of Canadian society.
Building a 21st century economy
A strong economy, built to succeed in the 21st century, is the pre-condition to fulfilling our aspirations, as a nation and as individuals.
A nation’s social and economic goals are inseparable. A stronger economy requires stronger social foundations. And if we want to build a fairer, more equitable society, we need a stronger economy.
Where do we want to be a decade from now?
We want a Canada that is a world leader in developing and applying the path-breaking technologies of the 21st century—biotechnology, environmental technology, information and communications technologies, health technologies, and nanotechnology. Applying these capabilities to all sectors to build globally competitive firms, from start-ups to multinationals. And creating high-quality jobs that will meet the ambitions of young Canadians—and keep them in this country, working to build an even greater Canada.
We foresee a Canada that is a magnet for capital and entrepreneurs from around the world.
A Canada where the increasing number of women entrepreneurs have every opportunity to succeed and contribute a vital new dimension to our economy.
A Canada built on innovation with world-class research universities, smart regulation and innovative financing, all combining to make Canada a global leader in the commercialization of bright ideas.
A Canada where the benefits of the 21st century economy are being reaped from coast to coast to coast—on our farms, in our fishing, forest, and mining industries, and in our rural communities where modern communications are helping to surmount the barrier of distance.
This will be achieved primarily through the efforts of Canadians themselves. But government has an essential enabling role.
A sound macroeconomic environment is fundamental. To ensure that the hard-won gains of the past decade are never squandered, the Government of Canada is unalterably committed to fiscal prudence, as evidenced by annual balanced budgets and steady reduction in the debt relative to the size of the economy. This Government will not spend itself into deficit.
Canada is a trading nation. And a 21st century economy is an economy open to the world. Canadian goods, services, capital, people, and knowledge must be able to reach international markets.
There are growing opportunities for Canadian exporters and investors to complement our enormously successful relationship with the United States by building closer economic ties with other regions of the world. In particular, more attention will be focused on such newly emerging economic giants as China, India, and Brazil.
Lifelong learning
Investing in people will be Canada’s most important economic investment.
The Government’s goal is to ensure that a lack of financial resources will not be allowed to deny, to those with the motivation and capacity, the opportunity to learn and aspire to excellence in pursuing a skilled trade, a community college diploma, or university degree.
To advance this objective, the Government of Canada will work with provinces and territories to modernize the Canada Student Loans Program to help overcome financial barriers to post-secondary education and training. It will update and improve grants and loans to increase access for middle-and low-income families and their children and to reflect the rising cost of education.
Loan limits will be increased, in recognition of the rising cost of education.
Eligible expenses will be broadened to include the new essentials, such as computers.
Family income thresholds will be raised to improve access for middle income families, squeezed by rising costs.
Measures will be taken to improve loan terms for part-time students.
But the answer to improved access must go beyond simply more generous loans, because a growing debt load poses its own limits, both psychologically and financially.
The Government will therefore provide a new grant for low-income students, to cover a portion of the tuition cost of the first year of post-secondary education.
More is also needed to encourage greater savings by families for their children’s education, starting from the earliest years of life. The Registered Education Savings Plan and associated savings grant have been extraordinarily successful stimulants, but participation by lower income families—often those who could most benefit—has been disappointingly low. The Government will therefore create new incentives that truly work to encourage low-income families to begin investing, right from the birth of their children, for their long-term education.
To meet the challenges of the new economy, Canada’s workers must have the opportunity to upgrade their skills, to improve their literacy, to learn on the job, to move onto the path of lifelong learning.
The Government will therefore refine and enhance its programs to encourage skills upgrading, in concert with sector councils, unions, and business.
The Government will also work with provinces to update labour market programming to better reflect the realities of work in the 21st century, such as the growth of self-employment and the need for continuous upgrading of skills.
We will also deepen the pool of Canada’s talent and skills by ensuring more successful integration of new immigrants into the economy and into communities. Immigrants have helped to build Canada from its inception and will be key to our future prosperity. The Government will do its part to ensure speedier recognition of foreign credentials and prior work experience. It will also implement measures to inform prospective immigrants and encourage the acquisition of necessary credentials before they arrive in Canada.
Science and technology
Canadian entrepreneurs have made great strides in building the innovative, technology-enabled economy needed to succeed in the years ahead. The Government of Canada has helped lay the foundation for even greater success with very substantial investments in basic research—$13 billion since 1997.
These investments are ensuring a continued flow of basic knowledge and highly trained people on which our future economic success depends.
Now we must do much more to ensure that our knowledge investment is converted to commercial success. We need to do more to get our ideas and innovations out of our minds and into the marketplace.
Our small, innovative firms face two key obstacles—access to adequate early-stage financing; and the capacity to conduct the research and development needed to commercialize their ideas and really grow their business.
The Government will help to overcome these obstacles—building, for example, on the venture financing capabilities of the Business Development Bank.
The Government will create access to capital for the commercialization of science in areas where we can be among the world leaders—in environment, in health, in biotechnology, and in nanotechnology.
The Government will also build on the experience and nationwide reach of the National Research Council to help small firms bridge the commercialization gap by providing the research and expertise that small business cannot develop on its own.
To help integrate and focus these efforts, Canada’s new National Science Advisor will re-engage universities, colleges, and enterprise in a truly national science agenda.
Regional and rural development
The 21st century economy promises opportunity for all parts of Canada. The objective of the Government is to ensure that every region of the country has the opportunity to move forward, socially and economically, on a rising tide of progress. As we share opportunity, so too will we share prosperity.
The Government therefore remains committed to supporting economic development through the regional agencies where the focus must be on strengthening the sinews of an economy for the 21st century, building on indigenous strength.
The Government will place increased emphasis on opportunities to add greater value to natural resources through application of advanced technology and know-how; on opportunities to develop Canada’s energy resources and be a leader in environmental stewardship; and on opportunities to maximize the potential of our vast coastal and offshore areas through a new Oceans Action Plan.
It will develop a Northern strategy, ensuring that economic development related to energy and mining is brought on stream in partnership with Northern Canadians, based on stewardship of our most fragile northern ecosystems.
The Government is dedicated to Canada’s farm economy and to taking the steps necessary to safeguard access to international markets and to ensure that farmers are not left to bear alone the consequences of circumstances beyond their control. It is also committed to fostering a technologically advanced agricultural sector with the supporting infrastructure of transportation and applied science to make the competitiveness of Canadian farmers and the safety of our food second to none in world markets.
Sustainable development
Safeguarding our natural environment—in the here and now, and for generations to come—is one of the great responsibilities of citizens and governments in the 21st century.
The tide of global population and the imperatives of economic development—no longer restricted to the small minority of rich countries—make sustainable development a challenge of national and global magnitude.
Canadians, as stewards of vast geography and abundant resources, feel a keen sense of responsibility to help the world meet the environmental challenge.
And in so doing, to show how this challenge can be turned to advantage through leadership in “green technologies”; through more energy-efficient transportation and housing; and through non-polluting industrial processes. All of which will stimulate innovation, new market opportunities, and cleaner communities.
This spirit will animate Canada’s approach to climate change.
Halting the increasingly damaging impact of human activity on climate is a project of global scale and decades duration.
The Government of Canada will respect its commitments to the Kyoto accord on climate change in a way that produces long-term and enduring results while maintaining a strong and growing economy. It will do so by developing an equitable national plan, in partnership with provincial and territorial governments and other stakeholders.
We have begun, and we will persevere. And we will go beyond Kyoto to strengthen our environmental stewardship.
First, the Government will begin by putting its own house in order. It will undertake a 10-year, $3.5 billion program to clean up contaminated sites for which the Government is responsible. And the Government of Canada will augment this with a $500 million program of similar duration to do its part in the remediation of certain other sites, notably the Sydney tar ponds.
Second, the Government will intensify its commitment to clean air and clean water. We will engage the United States on trans-boundary issues and the provinces to achieve more stringent national guidelines on air and water quality. And we are committing the resources needed to ensure safe drinking water in First Nations’ communities.
Third, building on recommendations of the National Roundtable on the Environment and the Economy, the Government will start incorporating key indicators on clean water, clean air, and emissions reduction into its decision making.
Fourth, the Government will increase the resources to support innovative environmental technologies and further encourage their commercialization.
Fifth, we will engage Canadians directly. Our One Tonne Challenge aims to raise awareness and provide Canadians with information on how their individual consumption choices contribute to the emissions that drive climate change. The objective—the challenge—is to reduce emissions by 1,000 kilograms per person, per year. Because environmental stewardship must be everybody’s responsibility.
Canada’s role in the world
Canadians are uniquely positioned for the new global realities—open to the world, comfortable with the interdependence of nations, aware of our global responsibilities.
Canadians want their country to play a distinctive and independent role in making the world more secure, more peaceful, more co-operative, more open. They want to see Canada’s place of pride and influence in the world restored.
What kind of world do we want to see a decade from now?
We want to see the benefits of global interdependence spread more fairly throughout the world.
We want agreement on new rules governing international actions when a government fails to protect its own people from tyranny and oppression.
We want to see multilateral institutions that work. No one nation can manage the consequences of global interdependence on its own.
We want to see greater collaboration among nations to ensure that economic policies go hand in hand with stronger social programs to alleviate hunger, poverty, and disease, and to help to raise the standards of living in developing countries.
Canada can contribute to achieving these goals.
We can play a distinctive role based on our values—the rule of law, liberty, democracy, equality of opportunity, and fairness. As others have said: the world needs more Canada.
Canada can make a difference and we can more than carry our weight. We need to work better, to work smarter, in diplomacy, in development, in defence and in international trade—all of which have become profoundly interdependent and are increasingly touching Canadians in their daily lives.
To guide us forward in this, the Government has launched an integrated review of its international policies—the first such review in a decade of change.
The review will be completed this autumn and then considered by a parliamentary committee, where Canadians will have the opportunity to make their views known.
Some things, however, need not wait for the review—because they are urgently needed, or because the right course of action is already clear.
There is a moral imperative to do all we can to make medical treatment accessible to the untold millions suffering from deadly infectious diseases, notably HIV/AIDS, particularly in the poorest countries of Africa. The Government of Canada will therefore proceed with legislation to enable the provision of generic drugs to developing countries.
Canada’s obligation does not stop there. We are a knowledge-rich country. We must apply more of our research and science to help address the most pressing problems of developing countries.
The Government will continue its leadership in the creation of a new international instrument on cultural diversity, participate actively in la Francophonie, and promote and disseminate our cultural products and works around the world.
And in 2010, the eyes of the world will be on Canada as Vancouver and Whistler host the Winter Olympics, an opportunity to inspire Canadian pride and achievement—and an opportunity to reinforce participation in sport by Canadians, at the highest level and in our communities.
Our foreign policy objectives require a meaningful capacity to contribute militarily in support of collective efforts to safeguard international peace and security. Our men and women in uniform put their lives on the line for us when they participate in operations abroad—as we were reminded tragically only last week. All Canadians support them and their families. We must ensure that they have the equipment and training to do the job.
To this end, the Government will make immediate investments in key capital equipment, such as new armoured vehicles and replacements for the Sea King helicopters.
There is no role more fundamental for government than the protection of its citizens.
That is why the Government has already established the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness and appointed a National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister. It has also established the Cabinet Committee on Security, Public Health and Emergencies and the new Canada Border Services Agency.
Given the responsibility to address new threats, such as non-state terrorism, and to ensure effective emergency management, the Government will develop, with its domestic partners, Canada’s first national security policy. This will publicly set forth the principles that will guide the Government’s actions and serve as a blueprint for effectively securing Canada in a way that strengthens the open nature of our society.
Canada and the United States are connected not only by the shared geography of North America and by hugely beneficial trade and investment flows—the largest bilateral economic relationship in the world—but also by ties of friendship and family, by commonly held democratic values, and by shared interests and responsibilities.
The Government is therefore committed to a new, more sophisticated approach to this unique relationship.
To ensure a border that is open and effective in handling the volumes of people, goods, and services flowing to and from our economies, the security concerns of both sides must be respected.
Building on the success of the Smart Borders initiative, the Government will engage with the United States to further strengthen North American security while facilitating the flow of commerce and travellers. It will also work toward infrastructure investments at key trade corridors to ensure that we can facilitate the expanding trade between our countries.
Conclusion
Canada and Canadians are confidently positioned to achieve great things in the years ahead.
We have set out measured steps consistent with our means. An ambitious agenda for an ambitious country.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate and
Members of the House of Commons:
As you carry out your duties and exercise your responsibilities, may you be guided by Divine Providence."
43,38,1,2004-10-05,liberal,"HONOURABLE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE,
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:
I congratulate both the returning members of Parliament, as well as the more than one hundred who are newly elected, as you take up your duties in the House of Commons for this Thirty-Eighth Parliament of Canada.
This year, Canadians commemorated the 60th anniversary of D-Day and the landing of allied forces in Europe—an event that spelled the beginning of the end of the Second World War. Canadian soldiers, sailors and aircrews fought with dogged bravery and were ultimately victorious on Juno Beach that day.
Shortly, I will be going to Italy to commemorate the significant campaign in which six thousand Canadians sacrificed their lives. To me, personally, these commemorations are a symbol of our eternal gratitude and an affirmation that we have not forgotten.
On these occasions, we are reminded of the huge debt we owe to those in uniform who have served this country—then and today. Our veterans connect generations and Canadians. As a country and as individuals, we gain in pride and in purpose from their deeds and their service.
I recently concluded extended visits to six cities of varying size—Saint John, Quebec City, Toronto, Saskatoon, Calgary and Vancouver. In them, I found remarkable, innovative projects for social renewal and individual commitment. They express the confidence and love that we all hold for this country. This is the spirit of Canada I see as Governor General.
The Government starts this new session with a commitment that all parliamentarians share—regardless of political affiliation—to contribute to real progress for Canadians, for this country, for our future. The Government faces a new Parliament fresh from an election. The people of Canada want this Government, and all parliamentarians, to rise above partisanship to address the public interest. They want their political leaders to catch up with Canadians’ own ambitions for the country and their readiness to take on the world with confidence.
Each of us must take responsibility. The Government will do its part to ensure that this minority Parliament works. Working together, we can unite the voices of all Canadians in common purpose.
The Government’s actions on behalf of Canadians will be guided by these seven commitments:
    to be unwavering in the application of fiscal discipline, the foundation of so much of Canada’s success over the past decade;
    to promote the national interest by setting the nation’s objectives and building a consensus toward achieving them;
    to pursue these objectives in a manner that recognizes Canada’s diversity as a source of strength and innovation;
    to aim for tangible, practical results for Canadians and report to them so that they can hold their governments to account;
    to defend the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and to be a steadfast advocate of inclusion;
    to demand equality of opportunity so that prosperity can be shared by all Canadians; and
    to assert Canada’s interests and project our values in the world.
Together, we can move Canada forward.
A STRONG ECONOMY
Our quality of life, job opportunities and capacity to support our social goals rely on a globally competitive economy.
Canada has a solid record of economic achievement. Over the past 10 years, we generated over three million new jobs. Since 1997, we have led all G7 countries in the growth of living standards. And low interest rates have made home ownership easier than it has been in decades.
This has not happened by accident. A virtuous circle led to increased confidence, lower interest rates and robust growth of well-paying jobs. The increase in revenues and the recovery of fiscal sovereignty have in turn permitted the Government to reduce and improve the fairness of taxes, and make new social and economic investments. This virtuous circle will continue.
We have been successful, but we will not be complacent. The Government will not spend itself into deficit. It will continue to pay down debt. Its objective is to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 25 per cent within 10 years. It will provide transparent, accountable management, treating every tax dollar with respect. The Government will make the difficult decisions among competing priorities and systematically review all expenditures, reallocating from old to new, from past to future.
Canada must now elevate its economic performance to the next level. Advancing technology and pervasive global competition demand of Canada a commitment to excellence, the pursuit of greater productivity, and a vision directed outward to the challenges and opportunities the world presents.
The Government will pursue a five-point strategy to build an even more globally competitive and sustainable economy.
The first element is to invest in people, Canada’s greatest source of creativity and economic strength.
We must invest in helping workers to continuously enhance their skills to keep pace with constantly evolving workplace requirements. To that end, the Government will develop a new Workplace Skills Strategy, including steps to enhance apprenticeship systems, and to boost literacy and other essential job skills. This will be
 
complemented by up-to-date training facilities and labour market agreements to be developed in collaboration with the provinces and territories, unions and sector councils.
The Government will continue to review the Employment Insurance program to ensure that it remains well-suited to the needs of Canada’s workforce.
Efforts to improve the recognition of foreign credentials and prior work experience have yielded too little progress. Looking to the growing contribution that will be required from new Canadians as our population ages, this Government will redouble its efforts, in cooperation with the provinces and professional bodies, to help integrate them into the workforce.
To increase access to post-secondary education, the Government will introduce legislation to implement its Learning Bond, an innovative savings vehicle that it announced to help low-income families provide for their children’s post-secondary education.
The second element of the economic strategy is to strengthen Canada’s ability to generate and apply new ideas.
The Government of Canada has made substantial investments—more than $13 billion since 1997—that have built a strong foundation in basic science and technology, including the Canada Foundation for Innovation, health research and other initiatives to create leading-edge capabilities. It will continue to build on this strength.
The National Science Advisor is assisting the Government to ensure that these investments are strategic, focused and delivering results, and is working to bring about a fuller integration of the Government’s substantial in-house science and technology activity.
The next challenge is to turn more of Canadians’ bright ideas into dynamic businesses, great jobs and growing export earnings. To that end, the Government will ensure a supply of venture capital, particularly for early-stage businesses—for example, through the venture financing arm of the Business Development Bank of Canada.
The Government will develop policies to foster Canadian capabilities in key enabling technologies—such as biotechnology, information and communications, and advanced materials—which will be drivers of innovation and productivity in the 21st century economy.
Providing “smart government”—the third element of our economic strategy—aims to make it easier for businesses to do business in Canada.
Smart government includes a transparent and predictable regulatory system that accomplishes public policy objectives efficiently while eliminating unintended impacts. This can be a key competitive advantage for Canada. That is why the Government welcomes the just-released report of the External Advisory Committee on Smart Regulation.
Smart government also includes providing an up-to-date legislative framework for business. The Government will therefore propose changes to modernize the Competition Act.
The fourth element of the Government’s overall economic strategy is a commitment to regional and sectoral development.
The Government will do its part to enable the success of important sectors, including automotive, aerospace and other manufacturing, as well as agriculture and other resource-based industries.
Canada’s regional economies are a vital source of economic strength and stability. Support for regional and rural economic development will target the fundamentals—skills upgrading, support for research and development, community development, and modern infrastructure such as broadband communication—by employing the regional agencies and tools such as the Atlantic Innovation Fund.
The Government’s regional objectives will be complemented by the most fundamental reform of the Equalization program in its 47-year history. The objective is to make more stable and predictable the total payments by the federal government to the less-wealthy provinces in support of key public services.
A region of particular challenge and opportunity is Canada’s North—a vast area of unique cultural and ecological significance. The Government will develop, in cooperation with its territorial partners, Aboriginal people and other northern residents, the first-ever comprehensive strategy for the North. This northern strategy will foster sustainable economic and human development; protect the northern environment and Canada’s sovereignty and security; and promote cooperation with the international circumpolar community.
Promotion of trade and investment is the fifth pillar of the Government’s economic strategy.
Strong investment will be the primary generator of growth and good jobs for the future. The Government will foster investment by attending to the conditions that encourage entrepreneurs and providers of risk capital. These include sound monetary and fiscal policies as well as competitive taxes, efficiently targeted to promote economic growth.
Canada has always been a trading nation, but never more so than today. It is therefore vital that we secure and enhance our access to markets, both in North America and the world. To this end, the Government will continue to push for an open, rules-based international trading system and a successful conclusion of the Doha Round of global trade negotiations.
Issues such as softwood lumber and BSE underline the importance the Government attaches to obtaining more reliable access to U.S. markets. It will build on the successful Smart Borders initiative and on measures designed to develop a more sophisticated and informed relationship involving business and government officials in the United States.
The Government will enhance its capacity to expand international trade and commerce, with a particular focus on North America and emerging markets.
To complement its international commerce initiatives, the Government is determined to forge a stronger Canadian economic union, free of the internal barriers that still diminish opportunities and reduce our competitiveness.
THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS
Canadians have told their governments, year after year, to renew Medicare, to stop bickering and work together to ensure that it will be there for them and their children. Governments have responded. On September 15, all fourteen First Ministers agreed on the Ten-year Plan to Strengthen Health Care.
The Plan sets out a clear commitment, shared by all provinces and territories, to achieve tangible results—results for patients. What united all First Ministers was the commitment to a meaningful reduction in wait times for health services because it is key to transforming the health system. The Plan holds all governments to account by establishing a requirement for evidence-based benchmarks, comparable indicators, clear targets and transparent reporting to the public on access to health care. This means that the needs of patients will drive change.
The Plan will accelerate reform and ensure better access to key tests and treatments. It will increase the number of doctors, nurses and other health professionals. This will be helped by quicker assessment and integration of those who have received their training abroad. The Plan will improve access to home and community care services and to safe and affordable drugs.
The Plan commits to a 10-year track of substantial, predictable long-term funding, closing what has been called the “Romanow Gap.” The Plan creates a Wait Times Reduction Fund, so that Canadians can see tangible progress in key areas such as cancer and heart treatment, diagnostic imaging, joint replacements and sight restoration.
The Plan addresses the unique challenges facing the delivery of health care services in Canada’s North, including the costs of medical transportation, and encourages innovative delivery of services to rural Canada.
As part of the Plan, governments will, for the first time, set goals and targets for improving the health status of Canadians. The Health Council of Canada will provide an annual report on health status and health outcomes, and will report on progress in implementing the Plan.
Funding arrangements will require that jurisdictions comply with the reporting provisions agreed to by First Ministers.
Better health for Canadians requires more than just timely access to health care. It requires the promotion of healthy living, addressing risk factors such as physical inactivity and nutrition; the prevention of injury; and integrated disease strategies. The Government will also work with partners to enhance sports activities at both the community and competitive levels.
The Government has already appointed a new Chief Public Health Officer for Canada to drive real change. The Government will also proceed with new health protection legislation. And it welcomes the development of the Pan-Canadian Public Health Network, which will strengthen collaboration among public health organizations nationwide. The Network will build capacity and provide coordinated responses to infectious disease outbreaks and other public health emergencies.
CHILDREN, CAREGIVERS AND SENIORS
For a decade, all governments have understood that the most important investment that can be made is in our children. That is why, even when it was fighting the deficit, the Government established the National Child Benefit—the most significant national social program since Medicare.
There is more that must be done to help families help their children. Parents must have real choices; children must have real opportunities to learn. The time has come for a truly national system of early learning and child care, a system based on the four key principles that parents and child care experts say matter—quality, universality, accessibility and development.
The Government will put the foundations in place with its provincial and territorial partners, charting a national course that focuses on results, builds on best practices and reports on progress to Canadians. Within this national framework, the provinces and territories will have the flexibility to address their own particular needs and circumstances.
As our society ages, Canadian families are caring not only for young children but increasingly for elderly spouses and grandparents as well.
The Government recognizes the vital role of Canadians who care for aged or infirm relatives or those with severe disabilities. It will improve its existing tax-based support and will ask Parliament to consult across the country on additional initiatives.
Building on previous measures, the Government will assist people with disabilities in becoming more self-reliant by drawing on the upcoming recommendations of the Technical Advisory Committee on Tax Measures for Persons with Disabilities.
Canada’s seniors are healthier and living longer than ever before. Many want to remain active and engaged in community life. To help them, the Government has announced the New Horizons program and will explore other means of ensuring that we do not lose the talents and contribution that seniors can make to our society.
Canada’s seniors have earned the right to be treated with dignity. As one step, the Government will increase the Guaranteed Income Supplement for Canada’s least well-off seniors.
ABORIGINAL CANADIANS
We must do more to ensure that Canada’s prosperity is shared by Canada’s Aboriginal people—First Nations, Inuit and Métis. We have made progress, but it is overshadowed by the rates of fetal alcohol syndrome and teen suicide in Aboriginal communities. These are the intolerable consequences of the yawning gaps that separate so many Aboriginal people from other Canadians—unacceptable gaps in education attainment, in employment, in basics like housing and clean water, and in the incidence of chronic diseases such as diabetes.
The Canada-Aboriginal Peoples Roundtable held last April was a major step along a new path of partnership and prosperity. The Government and Aboriginal leaders agreed to measurable goals to reduce these gaps and their consequences.
What could be more profound than targeting real change in the rate of fetal alcohol syndrome and teen suicide?
At their meeting on September 13 of this year, all First Ministers and Aboriginal leaders took action. There, this Government undertook to provide $700 million to encourage greater Aboriginal participation in the health professions, to address chronic diseases such as diabetes, and to create an Aboriginal Health Transition Fund to better adapt existing health care services to Aboriginal needs.
The Government is working together with Aboriginal Canadians and provincial and territorial governments to create the conditions for long-term development—learning, economic opportunity, and modern institutions of Aboriginal governance—while respecting historical rights and agreements.
The Government and Aboriginal people will together develop specific quality-of-life indicators and a “Report Card” to hold all to account and to drive progress.
CANADA’S CITIES AND COMMUNITIES
Canadians want their communities, towns and cities to be great places to live—safe, with affordable housing, good public transit, clean air and water, and abundant green spaces. Communities are key to our social goals and our economic competitiveness. They are the front lines in building a better quality of life.
Through the New Deal for Canada’s Cities and Communities, and working with the provinces and territories, the Government will make available, for the benefit of municipalities, a portion of the federal gas tax, growing over the next five years. These funds will enable municipalities to make long-term financial commitments needed to help contain urban sprawl and to invest in new sustainable infrastructure projects in areas like transit, roads, clean water and sewers.
To address key issues such as urban renewal, immigrant integration and the challenges facing off-reserve Aboriginal Canadians, the Government will expand the partnership approach used to develop the Vancouver and Winnipeg Agreements and proceed to implement its recent agreement with the Government of Ontario to cooperate in service delivery. The Government will also build on the work of the Harcourt Advisory Committee.
Shelter is the foundation upon which healthy communities and individual dignity are built. The Government will extend and enhance existing programs such as the Affordable Housing Initiative, the Supporting Communities Partnership Initiative for the homeless, and the Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Program.
What makes our communities strong is the willingness of men and women from all walks of life to take responsibility for their future and for one another. We can see this in the number of voluntary organizations and social economy enterprises that are finding local solutions to local problems. The Government is determined to foster the social economy—the myriad not-for-profit activities and enterprises that harness civic and entrepreneurial energies for community benefit right across Canada. The Government will help to create the conditions for their success, including the business environment within which they work. To that end, it will introduce a new Not-for-Profit Corporations Act.
What makes our communities work is our deep commitment to human rights and mutual respect. The Government is committed to these values. It will modernize Canada’s Citizenship Act to reaffirm the responsibilities and rights of Canadian citizenship and our values of multiculturalism, gender equality and linguistic duality. It is implementing the Official Languages Action Plan and will continue to promote the vitality of official language minority communities. It will take measures to strengthen Canada’s ability to combat racism, hate speech and hate crimes, both here at home and around the world. And it will table legislation to protect against trafficking in persons and to crack down on child pornography.
What makes our communities vibrant and creative is the quality of their cultural life. The Government will foster cultural institutions and policies that aspire to excellence, reflect a diverse and multicultural society, respond to the new challenges of globalization and the digital economy, and promote diversity of views and cultural expression at home and abroad.
OUR ENVIRONMENT
Our quality of life today, and the legacy we bequeath to future generations, demands fundamental change in the way in which we think about the environment.
The Government will work with its partners to build sustainable development systematically into decision making.
As the ethic and imperative of sustainability take deeper root worldwide, human ingenuity will turn increasingly to ways to produce and use energy more cleanly and efficiently; to eliminate toxins from our air, water and soil; and to build more sustainable communities. Here lie great new opportunities for the world economy. Canada’s entrepreneurs must aim to be at the leading edge.
To that end, the Government will work with the private sector to improve the commercialization of the best new environmental technologies. Major investments funded out of the proceeds of the sale of the Government’s Petro-Canada shares will support their development and deployment.
The Government will work to get its own house in order. It will consolidate federal environmental assessments and will work with the provinces and territories toward a unified and more effective assessment process for Canada. By 2006, the Government will implement a new Green Procurement Policy to govern its purchases. It will also introduce legislation that will strengthen the focus on the ecological integrity of Canada’s national parks.
Nowhere are the challenges and opportunities of sustainability more evident than in the way in which we use and produce energy. The Government will place increased focus on energy efficiency and energy research and development. It will engage stakeholders in developing comprehensive approaches to encourage increased production and use of clean, renewable energy and to promote greater energy efficiency. This will build on efforts already underway, including support for wind-power production in Canada, stimulated by a quadrupling of the Wind Power Production Incentive.
The Government reiterates that it will respect its commitment to the Kyoto Accord on climate change in a way that produces long-term and enduring results while maintaining a strong and growing economy. It will do so by refining and implementing an equitable national plan, in partnership with provincial and territorial governments and other stakeholders.
As the Government builds a sustainable society at home, it will continue to pursue multilateral and bilateral approaches to what are ultimately global challenges. For example, it will work with the United States and agencies like the International Joint Commission on issues such as clean air, clean water and invasive species. In 2005, the Government will bring forward the next generation of its Great Lakes and St. Lawrence programs, underscoring its commitment to protect and preserve these internationally significant shared ecosystems.
The Government will also move forward on its Oceans Action Plan by maximizing the use and development of oceans technology, establishing a network of marine protected areas, implementing integrated management plans, and enhancing the enforcement of rules governing oceans and fisheries, including rules governing straddling stocks.
A ROLE OF PRIDE AND INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD
In today’s world, effective international engagement is needed to advance national aspirations. Now that time and distance have lost their isolating effect, it is no longer possible to separate domestic and international policies. Canada’s internationalism is a real advantage, but we must find new ways to express it if we are to effectively assert our interests and project our values in a changing world.
Just as Canada’s domestic and international policies must work in concert, so too must our defence, diplomacy, development and trade efforts work in concert. This fall, the Government will release a comprehensive International Policy Statement that will reflect this integration. Parliamentarians and other Canadians will have the opportunity to debate its analyses and proposed directions.
Meanwhile, the world does not wait. The new security threats that face Canada demand new approaches immediately. The Government has already responded. In April of this year, it introduced Canada’s first-ever comprehensive National Security Policy, which will ensure a more focused and integrated approach to securing our open society. The Government is now implementing this policy. In this context, the Government is also deepening cooperation with the United States on mutual assistance in the event of major natural or human-caused emergencies.
This new context requires us to manage wisely our relationship with the United States, to know our friend better, and to strengthen our economic and security relations. Our relationship must be built on shared values, on mutual respect, and on a strong and independent voice for Canada.
Enhancing Canada’s security means that we have to invest more in our military as part of defending ourselves at home, in North America and in the world. We have to earn our way in the world. But ours will never be the biggest military force, so it must be smart, strategic and focused.
Canada’s proud tradition as a leader in peacekeeping is being tested today by increasing demands in extremely dangerous and politically complicated situations, often involving failed and failing states. We have seen what extraordinary work Canadian men and women can do in places like Afghanistan, Bosnia and Haiti. We know that Canadians are among the best in the world in meeting the challenge of being soldiers to make the peace, diplomats to negotiate the peace and aid workers to nurture the peace.
That is why the Government will be increasing our regular forces by some 5,000 troops and our reserves by 3,000 so that they may be better prepared and equipped to meet these challenges.
As Darfur and other situations have shown, sometimes intervention is best achieved by regional forces attuned to their cultural and geographic conditions. In such cases, particularly in Africa, Canada intends to continue playing a role by training regional peacekeepers, to prepare them to conduct challenging security operations within the principles of international humanitarian law.
In so many of the world’s trouble spots, establishing order is only the first step. Poverty, despair and violence are usually rooted in failed institutions of basic governance and rule of law. This is where Canada, with its commitment to pluralism and human rights, can make a unique contribution.
That is why the Government is establishing the Canada Corps. Its mandate is first, to put our idealism to work by helping young Canadians bring their enthusiasm and energy to the world; second, to bring our skills and ideas to bear by ensuring that experts of all ages and backgrounds—for example, in governance, health, economics, human rights—can get to the places in the world that need them; and third, to coordinate the efforts of government and to work with civil society. The Canada Corps will bring the best of Canadian values and experience to the world.
For all that we as Canadians want to achieve, and for all that we want for others, we also need international institutions that work. Dealing with complex issues like the “responsibility to protect” and managing the global commons will require leadership from all continents—from North and South. For that reason, the Government will work to bring about a meeting of G20 leaders to address common and pressing concerns, such as how to improve public health systems, combat terrorism and reform our multilateral institutions.
GOVERNING IN COMMON PURPOSE
The Government’s agenda for this Parliament is based on a comprehensive strategy to build a prosperous and sustainable 21st-century economy for Canada; strengthen the country’s social foundations; and secure for Canada a place of pride and influence in the world.
Supported by a committed and excellent public service, the Government will work diligently in this minority Parliament to address the priority areas it has identified. It will also introduce initiatives in many other areas, including commitments from the last Speech from the Throne, and will build on the work of Parliamentary committees, involve parliamentarians in the review of key appointments, and examine the need and options for reform of our democratic institutions, including electoral reform.
The Government invites members from both Chambers to join with it in the same democratic spirit: committed to unity and the inclusion of all regions and all voices, ready to work in common purpose on behalf of Canada.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate and Members of the House of Commons:
As you carry out your duties and exercise your responsibilities, may you be guided by Divine Providence."
44,39,1,2006-04-05,conservative,"Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
As the representative of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, I am honoured to welcome the newly elected members of the House of Commons on the occasion of the opening of the First Session of the Thirty-Ninth Parliament of Canada. Canadians rejoice in the coming eightieth birthday of Her Majesty later this month, and in her more than fifty years of service as Queen of Canada.
Since my appointment as Governor General of Canada, I have had the privilege of meeting women and men who each and every day, and each in their own way, reaffirm their attachment to this vast land that we share and where people from around the world have found a home. Women and men of ideas, conviction and action who have an abiding sense of responsibility, solidarity and commitment to their neighbourhoods, to their communities and to their country. And I am moved to see just how strong and vibrant a country we are.
I have been particularly struck by the words of our young people and by their wealth of ideas. Young people who are looking to carve out their place and be heard. The new generation of Aboriginal entrepreneurs who are creating new opportunities. Young people in our Canadian Forces who, through their extraordinary efforts, offer a promise of hope for the oppressed. More than ever, our young people represent not only the promise of a brighter future, but also the vitality of our present.
I have met with people from our two great linguistic communities and I can attest that our linguistic duality is a tremendous asset for the country. Similarly, Canadian artists from all disciplines have confirmed to me just how important creative expression is to the health of a democratic society.
And I have heard from Canadians who feel they often lack a voice. Women who are victims of violence. Families newly arrived in Canada who seek to contribute to our society and our country's collective well-being.
Listening to citizens from all walks of life has strengthened my already deep conviction that we are living in a country where everything is possible, where each of us is free to follow his or her dreams but also has a duty to help build our country and prepare it for the challenges that lie ahead.
Building a Stronger Canada
On January 23, the Canadian people elected a new government. The Government is honoured by the responsibility it has been given for managing the affairs of our great country.
Canada is uniquely blessed in the strength and diversity of its people and regions. Through hard work, foresight and good fortune, we have come together to make our vast country one of the most successful the world has ever seen.
The distance we have travelled is remarkable. A country once perceived to be at the edge of the world is now at the leading edge of science, business, the arts and sport. Whether it is on the podium in Turin, on the rugged hills of Afghanistan, or in the bustling markets of Asia, Canadians demonstrate time and time again that they are leaders.
The Government is proud of what Canadians have accomplished so far, and is inspired by the country's bright prospects. It believes in the capacity of Canadians to seize the enormous opportunities before them and build an even stronger Canada, striving for excellence, anchored by enduring values, and infused with growing confidence that they can make a difference at home and in the world.
In support of building a stronger Canada, the Government's agenda will be clear and focused. It will clean up government, provide real support to ordinary working families and strengthen our federation as well as our role in the world.
Turning a New Leaf
Canadians have chosen change. They want a government that treats their tax dollars with respect. A government that puts ordinary working people and their families first. A government that is accountable.
This Government has been given a mandate to lead the change demanded by the Canadian people.
Leading change in a minority Parliament means working together. To this end, the Government will look for shared goals and common ideas that will help Canadians build a stronger Canada.
It is time to turn a new leaf.
Bringing Accountability Back to Government
No aspect of responsible government is more fundamental than having the trust of citizens. Canadians' faith in the institutions and practices of government has been eroded. This new government trusts in the Canadian people, and its goal is that Canadians will once again trust in their government. It is time for accountability.
To restore this trust, the first piece of legislation the Government will bring forward will be the Federal Accountability Act.
This omnibus legislation and the associated Accountability Action Plan will change the current system of oversight and management by strengthening the rules and institutions that ensure transparency and accountability to Canadians. The legislation will ban institutional and large personal donations to political parties; it will ensure that positions of public trust cannot be used as stepping stones to private lobbying; and it will provide real protection for whistle-blowers who show great courage in coming forward to do what is right.
The Government will strengthen the capacity and independence of officers of Parliament, including the Auditor General, to hold the Government to account. It will increase the transparency of appointments, contracts and auditing within government departments and Crown corporations.
Effective checks and balances are important, but they are not enough. The trust of citizens must be earned every day. The Government will work to earn that trust.
Helping Ordinary Working Canadians and Their Families
This Government believes that Canadians pay too much in tax. The Government's tax plan will, over time, reduce the tax burden on all Canadians.
To this end, the Government will reduce the Goods and Services Tax by one percent. Cutting the GST will help all Canadians deal with the rising cost of living, put money back in people's pockets and help stimulate the economy.
Cutting the GST is the best way to lower taxes for all Canadians, including low-income Canadians who need it most.
The Government will continue with a responsible approach to lowering taxes for the benefit of Canadians and the Canadian economy, including a further reduction of the GST to five percent.
Tackling Crime
Canadians have always taken pride in our low crime rates. Safe streets have long characterized Canada's communities -- from villages to towns to cities. Safe communities allow families and businesses to prosper.
Unfortunately, our safe streets and healthy communities are increasingly under threat of gun, gang and drug violence.
This Government will tackle crime. It will propose changes to the Criminal Code to provide tougher sentences for violent and repeat offenders, particularly those involved in weapons-related crimes. It will help prevent crime by putting more police on the street and improving the security of our borders.
It is equally important that we prevent criminal behaviour before it has a chance to take root. To this end, the Government will work with the provinces and territories to help communities provide hope and opportunity for our youth, and end the cycle of violence that can lead to broken communities and broken lives.
Providing Child Care Choice and Support
Strong families ensure a bright future for Canada. The most important investment we can make as a country is to help families raise their children.
This Government understands that no two Canadian families are exactly alike. Each has its own circumstances and needs. Parents must be able to choose the child care that is best for them. The Government will help Canadian parents, as they seek to balance work and family life, by supporting their child care choices through direct financial support.
In collaboration with the provinces and territories, employers and community non-profit organizations, it will also encourage the creation of new child care spaces.
Ensuring Canadians Get the Health Care They Have Paid For
Canadians have paid their taxes to support our system of public health insurance. But all too often, they find themselves waiting too long for critical procedures. That is not good enough. It is time Canadians received the health care they have paid for.
The Government will engage the provinces and territories on a patient wait times guarantee for medically necessary services. This guarantee will make sure that all Canadians receive essential medical treatment within clinically acceptable waiting times.
A health system that is timely and sustainable will require innovation. The Government will support and enable innovative approaches to health care delivery consistent with the principles of a universally accessible and equitable public health care system embodied in the Canada Health Act.
A Canada That Works for All of Us
One of Canada's greatest strengths is our federal system of government. The founders of our country had the foresight to build a flexible federal system that would accommodate our diversity and build upon the unique strengths of the different parts of our federation.
To remain strong and effective, our federation must keep pace with the evolving needs of Canadian society. Building on the work begun in the last Parliament, this Government will seek to involve parliamentarians and citizens in examining the challenges facing Canada's electoral system and democratic institutions. At the same time, it will explore means to ensure that the Senate better reflects both the democratic values of Canadians and the needs of Canada's regions.
All too often, the strength of our federation is compromised by jurisdictional squabbles that obscure accountabilities and prevent governments from working together in the best interests of Canadians.
This new government will take a new approach. It is committed to building a better federation in which governments come together to help Canadians realize their potential. To this end, the Government will respond to concerns about the fiscal imbalance and will work to ensure fiscal arrangements in which all governments have access to the resources they need to meet their responsibilities.
The Government is committed to an open federalism that recognizes the unique place of a strong, vibrant Quebec in a united Canada. It will work with the government and legislature of Quebec in a spirit of mutual respect and collaboration to advance the aspirations of Quebecers. In the international community, Canada is stronger when we speak with one voice, but that voice must belong to all of us. In a more interdependent world, decisions on international issues increasingly affect not only countries, but also individuals, communities and regions.
This is why the Government will facilitate provincial participation in the development of Canadian positions that affect areas of provincial responsibility. The Government recognizes the special cultural responsibilities of the Government of Quebec and will therefore invite Quebec to play a role in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. By harnessing the diversity of experience and expertise found within our federation, we can present a strong, united and confident voice to the world.
Canada - Strong, United, Independent and Free
Canada's voice in the world must be supported by action, both at home and abroad. Advancing our interests in a complex and sometimes dangerous world requires confidence and the independent capacity to defend our country's sovereignty and the security of our citizens.
The Government will work cooperatively with our friends and allies and constructively with the international community to advance common values and interests. In support of this goal, it will build stronger multilateral and bilateral relationships, starting with Canada's relationship with the United States, our best friend and largest trading partner.
More broadly, this Government is committed to supporting Canada's core values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights around the world. In this regard, the Government will support a more robust diplomatic role for Canada, a stronger military and a more effective use of Canadian aid dollars.
Just as it honours the past efforts of our veterans, the Government stands firmly behind the vital role being played by our troops in Afghanistan today. The dedicated Canadians in Afghanistan deserve all of our support as they risk their lives to defend our national interests, combat global terrorism and help the Afghan people make a new start as a free, democratic and peaceful country.
Conclusion
The Government's clear and focused agenda reflects its commitment to Canadians. It will not try to do all things at once. Instead, the Government will work diligently to make tangible improvements that contribute to stronger families and safer communities, and a stronger country.
During this Thirty-Ninth Parliament, the Government will be bringing forward fiscally responsible budgets and a legislative program that will achieve the results that Canadians expect from their elected representatives. In this work, it will rely on the support and counsel of a dedicated and professional Public Service. In turn, it will give the Public Service the leadership and tools it needs to excel in the service of Canadians. Recognizing the important role of parliamentarians, members of Parliament will be asked to conduct comprehensive reviews of key federal legislation, including the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Bank Act. The Government will act in Parliament to offer an apology for the Chinese Head Tax. Significant international treaties will be submitted for votes in Parliament.
Over the course of its mandate, and starting with the clear priorities set out today, the Government will work diligently to build a record of results. It will promote a more competitive, more productive Canadian economy. It will seek to improve opportunity for all Canadians, including Aboriginal peoples and new immigrants. It will work to improve the security of seniors. It will take measures to achieve tangible improvements in our environment, including reductions in pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
This Government recognizes the unique challenges faced by those who make their livelihood from our land and oceans in our vital natural resource and agriculture industries. It will take action to secure a prosperous future for Canadian agriculture, following years of neglect. It will respond to short-term needs, create separate and more effective farm income stabilization and disaster relief programs and work with producers and partners to achieve long-term competitiveness and sustainability.
Together, the Government's actions will ensure Canada's future success.
With the efforts and contributions of members from both chambers, the Government looks forward to making this Parliament work for the benefit of the Canadian people.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate and Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence guide your deliberations."
45,39,2,2007-10-16,conservative,"Honourable Senators,
Members of the House of Commons,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I would like to address the first words in this chamber to the members of the Canadian Forces, some of whom are present here today. Their commitment and courage in the name of justice, equality and freedom — whose benefits are not accorded to all peoples in the world — are worthy of our utmost respect.
The Speech from the Throne is an important moment in our country's democratic life. Through the Speech from the Throne, the Government shares its vision with Canadians. And it is thus that we open the Second Session of the Thirty- ninth Parliament today.
Fifty years ago, on October 14, 1957, during her first visit to Canada as its Sovereign, and for the first time in Canadian history, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II opened the First Session of the Twenty-third Parliament.
This room is filled with history, and we mark history again this year as we celebrate a number of anniversaries. I think, in particular, of the bicentenary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act in the British Empire . I also think of the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Citizenship Act on January 1, 1947. And I think of the 40th anniversary of the Order of Canada , whose one hundredth investiture ceremony we will soon be celebrating at Rideau Hall.
And although Canada is a young country, its history is marked by our unwavering willingness — which I was touched to see all across Canada — to be and to continue to be a generous society. A society that is concerned about the well being of others. A society that is protective of the spirit of this bountiful land, a deep respect learned from Aboriginal peoples. A society that is committed to finding solutions to today's challenges. A society that is open to creation and quick to innovate. A society that is filled with young people who have an unprecedented openness to the world.
STRONG LEADERSHIP. A BETTER CANADA .
Canada is the greatest country in the world, a nation of enormous potential built through the imagination and dedication of ordinary Canadians. Canadians who have worked hard to build a better life for their families. Canadians who have joined with their neighbours to create a society founded on peace and prosperity.
Canada is their legacy to us.
Canadians expect their government to help them build on this legacy. They want a government that sets clear goals and delivers concrete results. A government that is accountable. A government that puts Canadians and their families first.
Our Government has worked hard to meet these expectations. Canadians now have more money in their pockets because taxes have been cut. Families now have real choice in child care through the Universal Child Care Benefit. Canadians now have a government committed to helping them get the medical care they need more quickly. A government that is tackling crime and making neighbourhoods safer.
The results are clear: the economy is strong, the government is clean and the country is united.
Now is the time to continue building a better Canada . In the next session, our Government will focus on five clear priorities: strengthening Canada 's sovereignty and place in the world; building a stronger federation; providing effective economic leadership; continuing to tackle crime; and improving our environment.
STRENGTHENING CANADA 'S SOVEREIGNTY AND PLACE IN THE WORLD
Canada is built on a common heritage of values, which Canadians have fought and died to defend. It is a country that continues to attract newcomers seeking refuge and opportunity, who see Canada as a place where they can work hard, raise families and live in freedom. Our Government is resolved to uphold this heritage by protecting our sovereignty at home and living by our values abroad.
The Arctic is an essential part of Canada 's history. One of our Fathers of Confederation, D'Arcy McGee, spoke of Canada as a northern nation, bounded by the blue rim of the ocean. Canadians see in our North an expression of our deepest aspirations: our sense of exploration, the beauty and the bounty of our land, and our limitless potential.
But the North needs new attention. New opportunities are emerging across the Arctic , and new challenges from other shores. Our Government will bring forward an integrated northern strategy focused on strengthening Canada 's sovereignty, protecting our environmental heritage, promoting economic and social development, and improving and devolving governance, so that northerners have greater control over their destinies.
To take advantage of the North's vast opportunities, northerners must be able to meet their basic needs. Our Government will work to continue to improve living conditions in the North for First Nations and Inuit through better housing.
Our Government will build a world-class Arctic research station that will be on the cutting edge of Arctic issues, including environmental science and resource development. This station will be built by Canadians, in Canada 's Arctic , and it will be there to serve the world.
As part of asserting sovereignty in the Arctic, our Government will complete comprehensive mapping of Canada 's Arctic seabed. Never before has this part of Canada 's ocean floor been fully mapped.
Defending our sovereignty in the North also demands that we maintain the capacity to act. New Arctic patrol ships and expanded aerial surveillance will guard Canada 's Far North and the Northwest Passage . As well, the size and capabilities of the Arctic Rangers will be expanded to better patrol our vast Arctic territory.
Ensuring our capacity to defend Canada 's sovereignty is at the heart of the Government's efforts to rebuild the Canadian Forces. Canada 's men and women in uniform risk their lives for their country, and deserve the equipment and training required for a first-class, modern military. Our Government will modernize Canada 's military to provide effective surveillance and protection for all of our country, cooperate in the defence of North America , and meet our responsibilities abroad to the United Nations and our allies. Further, recognizing the important role that the Reserves play in this modernization, our Government will work with the provinces and territories to bring forward a comprehensive plan to modernize reservist reinstatement policies.
At the same time as our Government rebuilds to meet our future needs, it will continue to improve support for our veterans who have contributed so much to defending Canada in the past.
Rebuilding our capabilities and standing up for our sovereignty have sent a clear message to the world: Canada is back as a credible player on the international stage. Our Government believes that focus and action, rather than rhetoric and posturing, are restoring our influence in global affairs. Guided by our shared values of democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law, our Government will continue Canada 's international leadership through concrete actions that bring results.
A commitment to action means that Canada must make common cause with those fighting for the values we uphold. Our Government will immediately call upon Parliament to confer honorary citizenship on Aung San Suu Kyi . Her long struggle to bring freedom and democracy to the people of Burma has made her the embodiment of these ideals and an inspiration to all of us.
Nowhere is Canada making a difference more clearly than in Afghanistan . Canada has joined the United Nations- sanctioned mission in Afghanistan because it is noble and necessary. Canadians understand that development and security go hand in hand. Without security, there can be no humanitarian aid, no reconstruction and no democratic development. Progress will be slow, but our efforts are bearing fruit. There is no better measure of this progress than the four million Afghan boys and two million girls who can dream of a better future because they now go to school.
The Canadian Forces mission in Afghanistan has been approved by Parliament until February 2009, and our Government has made clear to Canadians and our allies that any future military deployments must also be supported by a majority of parliamentarians. In the coming session, members will be asked to vote on the future of the Canadian mission in Afghanistan . This decision should honour the dedication and sacrifice of Canada 's development workers, diplomats and men and women in uniform. It should ensure that progress in Afghanistan is not lost and that our international commitments and reputation are upheld.
Our Government does not believe that Canada should simply abandon the people of Afghanistan after February 2009. Canada should build on its accomplishments and shift to accelerate the training of the Afghan army and police so that the Afghan government can defend its own sovereignty. This will not be completed by February 2009, but our Government believes this objective should be achievable by 2011, the end of the period covered by the Afghanistan Compact. Our Government has appointed an independent panel to advise Canadians on how best to proceed given these considerations.
In our own neighbourhood, the Americas , Canada is back playing an active role. The Canadian model of constitutional democracy and economic openness combined with social safety nets, equitable wealth creation and sharing across regions has much to offer those countries struggling to build a better future.
Canada 's efforts in Haiti are a compelling example of how we can work with our neighbours to ensure security and development. Canadians understand that our country has a responsibility to help countries struggling to make a better life for their people — particularly in promoting democratic governance in fragile states. In Haiti and elsewhere, our Government will bring greater focus and effectiveness to Canada 's international assistance to ensure that Canadians' money is well spent.
The best hope for fostering development and our common security in the hemisphere and beyond is through bolstering international trade. Through renewed focus on trade and investment arrangements, Canada has already secured a deal with the European Free Trade Association, the first new agreement in more than half a decade. Our Government will keep advancing Canada 's trade interests in the Americas and around the world to open up new markets for Canada 's innovators.
STRENGTHENING THE FEDERATION AND OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS
Next year we mark important anniversaries spanning our country and its history. We will celebrate the 400th anniversary of the founding of Quebec City . Canada was born in French, reflected in the presence of francophones throughout Canada , and in Parliament's recognition that the Québécois form a nation within our united country.
We will also celebrate the 250th anniversary of the establishment of Nova Scotia 's representative assembly, which marks the birth of Canadian parliamentary democracy, and the 150th anniversary of the founding of the Crown Colony of British Columbia.
John A. Macdonald, George- Étienne Cartier and the other Fathers of Confederation brought many peoples and regions together to create a federation that has served Canadians well for 140 years.
Our Government is committed to strengthening that union: it has concentrated on its national role by reinvesting in neglected federal responsibilities, such as trade, defence, public safety and security. It has put fiscal relations with provinces and territories on a principled basis and increased the level of transfers to support quality health care and social services.
Our Government believes that the constitutional jurisdiction of each order of government should be respected. To this end, guided by our federalism of openness, our Government will introduce legislation to place formal limits on the use of the federal spending power for new shared-cost programs in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. This legislation will allow provinces and territories to opt out with reasonable compensation if they offer compatible programs.
Our Government will also pursue the federal government's rightful leadership in strengthening Canada 's economic union. Despite the globalization of markets, Canada still has a long way to go to establish free trade among our provinces. It is often harder to move goods and services across provincial boundaries than across our international borders. This hurts our competitive position but, more importantly, it is just not the way a country should work. Our Government will consider how to use the federal trade and commerce power to make our economic union work better for Canadians.
Canadians understand that the federation is only as strong as the democratic institutions that underpin it. Our Government believes that Canada is not well served by the Senate in its current form. To ensure that our institutions reflect our shared commitment to democracy, our Government will continue its agenda of democratic reform by reintroducing important pieces of legislation from the last session, including direct consultations with voters on the selection of Senators and limitations on their tenure.
In addition, the integrity of our federal voting system will be further strengthened through measures to confirm the visual identification of voters.
Our Government supports Canada 's linguistic duality. It will renew its commitment to official languages in Canada by developing a strategy for the next phase of the Action Plan for Official Languages.
Our Government remains committed to improving the lives of Canada 's Aboriginal people. The Government will reintroduce legislation to guarantee to people living on reserve the same protections other Canadians enjoy under the Canadian Human Rights Act . Our Government will also present legislation on specific claims, which will finally bring fairness and timely resolution to the claims process.
Our Government recently concluded a final settlement on Indian Residential Schools and will launch a commission for truth and reconciliation. The Prime Minister, on behalf of our Government, will use this occasion to make a statement of apology to close this sad chapter in our history.
PROVIDING EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP FOR A PROSPEROUS FUTURE
This is a time of economic uncertainty and volatility in the wider world. While the economic fundamentals of our country are strong, Canada is not immune from this turbulence. Canadians understand these challenges and want a government that is a competent and effective manager of the economy.
With Advantage Canada , our Government has laid out a sensible economic plan to secure better-paying jobs and solid growth for Canadians. The Minister of Finance will soon provide a Fall Economic and Fiscal Update, which will outline the next steps in that plan to ensure that Canada has a modern infrastructure, an innovative and entrepreneurial business environment, and a tax system that rewards hard work — all based on a foundation of sound fiscal management.
As part of ensuring economic security for Canadians, our Government will bring forward a long-term plan of broad- based tax relief for individuals, businesses and families — including following through on its commitment to a further cut to the GST. To complement this, our Government will support Canadian researchers and innovators in developing new ideas and bringing them to the marketplace through Canada 's Science and Technology Strategy.
Our Government will improve the protection of cultural and intellectual property rights in Canada , including copyright reform. Our Government will also take measures to improve the governance and management of the Employment Insurance Account.
The bedrock of our workforce is middle-class Canadians and their families. These families worry about the rising costs of higher education and the expense of caring for elderly parents. They worry about affordable housing and the number of homeless people on our streets.
Our Government is committed to helping Canadian families meet their needs. The Working Income Tax Benefit will help Canadians get back into the workforce, and the registered disability savings plan will help families care for children with severe disabilities. Our Government will continue to invest in our families and our future, and will help those seeking to break free from the cycles of homelessness and poverty.
Our Government will announce an infrastructure program, the Building Canada Plan, to support our long- term growth. By investing in our transport and trade hubs, including the Windsor — Detroit corridor and the Atlantic and Pacific gateways, our Government will help rebuild our fundamentals for continued growth.
The result will be safer roads and bridges, shorter commutes, more competitive business, improved cultural infrastructure and a better quality of life for all Canadians.
Our Government will stand up for Canada 's traditional industries. Key sectors including forestry, fisheries, manufacturing and tourism are facing challenges. Our Government has taken action to support workers as these industries adjust to global conditions and will continue to do so in the next session.
The agricultural sector will benefit from our Government's promotion of biofuels and the new Growing Forward agricultural framework. Our Government will recognize the views of farmers, as expressed in the recent plebiscite on barley, by enacting marketing choice. Together with our Government's strong support for Canada 's supply- managed system, these approaches will deliver stable, predictable and bankable support for farm families.
Our mining and resource sectors present extraordinary opportunities across Canada , and our Government will help move forward by providing a single window for major project approvals. With these increased opportunities for employment, our Government will continue to foster partnerships that help Aboriginal people get the skills and training to take advantage of these job prospects in the North and across Canada .
TACKLING CRIME AND STRENGTHENING THE SECURITY OF CANADIANS
Canada was founded on the principles of peace, order and good government. This is the birthright of all Canadians; yet Canadians feel less safe today and rightly worry about the security of their neighbourhoods and the country. There is no greater responsibility for a government than to protect this right to safety and security.
In the last session, our Government introduced important and timely legislation to tackle violent crime. Unfortunately much of this legislation did not pass. That is not good enough to maintain the confidence of Canadians. Our Government will immediately reintroduce these measures with a single, comprehensive Tackling Violent Crime bill to protect Canadians and their communities from violent criminals and predators. This will include measures on the age of protection, impaired driving, dangerous offenders and stricter bail and mandatory prison sentences for those who commit gun crimes. Canadians expect prompt passage of this crucial legislation.
Our Government will go further with a Safer Communities strategy to deal with the critical intersection of drug, youth and property crime. Our Government will strengthen the Youth Criminal Justice Act to ensure that young offenders who commit serious crimes are held accountable to victims and their communities. Our Government will introduce tough new laws to tackle property crime, including the serious problem of auto theft. New measures to address elder abuse and to curb identity theft will also be introduced. Our Government will implement the National Anti-Drug Strategy giving law enforcement agencies powers to take on those who produce and push drugs on our streets.
In addition to tougher laws, our Government will provide targeted support to communities and victims. It will help families and local communities in steering vulnerable youth away from a life of drugs and crime, and the Anti-Drug Strategy will help to treat those suffering from drug addiction. It will again ask Parliament to repeal the wasteful long-gun registry. Our Government will also ensure effective law enforcement — starting with resources to recruit 2,500 more officers to police our streets.
The concern of Canadians in protecting our communities extends naturally to protecting our country against threats to our national security: those who would attack the peaceful pluralism of our society through acts of terrorism. Canada has experienced the tragedy of terrorism before. The report from the public inquiry into the Air India bombing will be an important contribution to safeguarding the lives of Canadians in the future.
Our Government will address Canadians directly on the challenge of protecting our free and open society with a statement on national security. The Government will introduce legislation to make sure that Canada has the tools it needs to stop those who would threaten our cities, communities and families, including measures to strengthen the Anti-Terrorism Act and to respond to the Supreme Court decision on security certificates.
IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH OF CANADIANS
Threats to our environment are a clear and present danger that now confronts governments around the world. This is nowhere more evident than in the growing challenge of climate change.
Our Government believes that action is needed now to ensure our quality of life, particularly for those most vulnerable to health threats from the environment — our children and seniors.
Climate change is a global issue and requires a global solution. Our Government believes strongly that an effective global approach to greenhouse gas emissions must have binding targets that apply to all major emitters, including Canada . Canada has already engaged the international community at APEC, the G8 and the United Nations and will continue to press for a new international agreement that cuts global emissions in half by 2050.
As we pursue a global consensus, Canada is acting even more aggressively at home. Our Government will implement our national strategy to reduce Canada 's total greenhouse gas emissions 60 to 70 percent by 2050. There will be a 20 percent reduction by 2020. Our Government will bring forward the elements from Canada 's Clean Air Act, which had all-party consensus, for parliamentary consideration.
This strategy will institute binding national regulations on greenhouse gas emissions across all major industrial sectors — with requirements for emissions reductions starting this year. Our Government will also bring forward the first-ever national air pollution regulations. In so doing, our Government will put Canada at the forefront of clean technologies to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Our Government will also establish a carbon emissions trading market that will give business the incentive to run cleaner, greener operations.
At the end of 2005, Canada 's greenhouse gas emissions were 33 percent above the Kyoto commitment. It is now widely understood that, because of inaction on greenhouse gases over the last decade, Canada 's emissions cannot be brought to the level required under the Kyoto Protocol within the compliance period, which begins on January 1, 2008, just 77 days from now.
The world is moving on to address climate change and the environment, and Canada intends to help lead the effort at home and abroad.
Beyond regulating greenhouse gases and air pollution, our Government has also acted to protect sensitive areas, including a massive expansion of Nahanni National Park, and preserving the Great Bear Rainforest, Point Pleasant Park and Stanley Park. Through our new infrastructure plan, our Government will promote a cleaner environment by investing in public transport and water treatment, and by cleaning up contaminated sites. A new water strategy will be implemented to help clean up our major lakes and oceans and to improve access to safe drinking water for First Nations.
In the past, environmental legislation and regulation have had little impact because they have lacked an effective enforcement regime. In the coming session, our Government will bolster the protection of our water and land through tougher environmental enforcement that will make polluters accountable.
Environmental protection is not just about protecting nature. It is about the health of Canadians. Recent events have called into question the safety of basic products such as food for our families and toys for our children.
Our Government shares the concern of parents about the safety of consumer products and food. Canadians should expect the same standards of quality from imported goods as they do from products made at home. The Government will introduce measures on food and product safety to ensure that families have confidence in the quality and safety of what they buy.
CONCLUSION: THE NORTH STAR
Canadians can be proud of their country and its achievements. Working together we have built a nation that is prosperous and safe; a land where merit trumps privilege; a place where people from around the world live in harmony; a federation that is united at home and respected abroad.
Like the North Star, Canada has been a guide to other nations; through difficult times, Canada has shone as an example of what a people joined in common purpose can achieve. Yet Canada 's greatest strength lies in its energy and determination to move forward and build a better future.
Our Government is committed to strong leadership to realize that future. A Canada proud of its leadership in the world and confident in its economic future. A Canada built on a strong federation and a robust democracy. A Canada that is safe for our families and healthy for our children.
Canadians, standing on a proud history, look onto a horizon as limitless as the promise of our country. It is up to us to build on the legacy we have inherited, to seize the opportunities of the future, and to bring about an even better Canada for our children.
May your deliberations be guided by Divine Providence, may your wisdom and patriotism enlarge the prosperity of the country and promote in every way the well-being of its people."
46,40,1,2008-11-19,conservative,"Honourable Members of the Senate ,
Members of the House of Commons,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Two hundred and fifty years ago, on October 2, 1758, the first parliamentary assembly of its kind in Canada was held in Nova Scotia . It is worth solemnly remembering in this Chamber the historic significance of that event.
Because today, we are free to reach our full potential thanks to the efforts of women and men, young and old, who established democracy in this country, where anything is possible.
This country is made up of every hope we cherish, every dream we pursue, every project we realize.
Upholding the ideal of democracy that we embody in the world is a responsibility that each of us bears.
As the great-great-granddaughter of slaves, born under one of the most brutal dictatorships in history, I know just how precious this legacy is to the citizens of this country. They have again and again expressed their pride in this legacy to me, through their words and deeds, over the past three years.
In these uncertain economic times, it is more important than ever that our spirit of solidarity prevails and reaches beyond our borders, so that Canada represents not only a hope of renewal, but also a promise for the future.
Today, in this democratic tradition, the representatives of the Canadian people gather for the 40th time in this great nation's history to open a new federal Parliament.
For over 140 years, since the era of Queen Victoria, Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir George-Etienne Cartier and the other Fathers of Confederation, the Parliament of Canada has assembled to deliberate upon the great issues of the day.
This institution thus represents one of the longest and most unblemished records of peaceful, democratic self-government anywhere on Earth.
The people spoke once again in a general election on October 14th, and entrusted this Government with a renewed and strengthened mandate.
At the same time, the people also chose to elect a minority Parliament. And in a parliamentary democracy such as ours, the government must always be responsible and accountable to the people's representatives.
Our Government is mindful of both the privilege and the responsibility with which we have been entrusted.
This is a time of extraordinary global economic challenge and uncertainty. The world's financial system faces pressures not seen for many generations. Governments around the world have taken unprecedented steps to restore confidence in the face of a global economic slowdown.
As Canadians watch these developments unfold, they rightly wonder about what they might mean here at home, for their jobs, their savings and their families' well-being. Canadians know that, as Canada is a trading nation in the global economy, these events—while originating outside our borders—will nevertheless reverberate here.
In the face of this uncertainty, just as when faced with difficulties before, Canadians will prevail.
Canada was founded on the belief that, by joining our strength in confederation, our united country would be able to meet and rise above any challenge set before us.
From the explorers and pioneers to the settlers and railroad builders, this vast country was built by people who took tremendous risks and braved unforgiving elements for the prospect of a better future.
The dawn of a new century saw new challenges. In a war that ended ninety years ago last week, our young country came of age on battlefields whose names echo across our history—Ypres, Vimy, Passchendaele. The generation that followed overcame the Depression and again confronted the devastation of war. The achievements of these generations are marked not only by monuments to their bravery and sacrifices, but also by their legacy in forging Canada as one of the most peaceful and prosperous nations on Earth.
We know that Canadians will face the problems of today with the same spirit of determination and resolve as those who came before us faced the challenges of their generation. And like them, we know that we will emerge stronger than ever.
In this time of global economic instability, we can be reassured that the hard work of millions of Canadians has laid a solid foundation for our country. We have pursued policies different from those of many of our trading partners. We have paid down debt and kept spending under control. We have set public pensions on a sound footing and refinanced important programs such as health care and post-secondary education. Our banks are among the strongest and best regulated in the world. Canadian households and businesses have been prudent and avoided taking on the excessive debt witnessed elsewhere.
Embarking on its renewed mandate, our Government is committed to providing the strong leadership that Canadians expect. It will protect Canadians in difficult times. It will work with Canadians to secure our future prosperity. It will support Canadian workers and businesses in their pursuit of a better future. And our Government will continue its pursuit of distinctly Canadian policies that will contribute to a better economy.
Our Government has a clear approach to Canada 's economic security. It will work with its partners to help address the current international crisis. It will maintain a prudent course for the country's finances. It will take action to support the economy today while building a stronger economy for the future.
As our Government dedicates its efforts over the months ahead to supporting the Canadian economy, so too does it rededicate itself to working in partnership with others to achieve this goal. Canadians expect federal and provincial governments to work together to steer us through the current economic turmoil and, ultimately, build a stronger Canada . To this end, First Ministers met on November 10th and will meet again in the New Year.
Reforming Global Finance
The first order of business must be to put the international financial system on a sounder footing. Just as these troubles began beyond our borders, so will their solution demand that Canada engage its partners and allies around the world.
Canada will use its experience in developing a strong model of financial regulation to help lead the world in the repair and strengthening of the international financial system. The Prime Minister and Minister of Finance began this important work on November 15th, joining the leaders of the G20 in Washington, D.C. , to re-examine and renew the rules and institutions that underpin the global financial system.
The financial sector exists to serve the economy. Without sound financial institutions, loans would not be available for home ownership. Businesses would be cut off from the credit needed to expand and hire new workers. By choking off financing to the global economy, the credit crisis has dramatically weakened the prospects of growth. Canada will play a leading role to help resolve the crisis, maintain free and open markets, and advance Canada 's interests.
The credit crisis has also underlined the dangers of a fragmented financial regulatory system. To further strengthen financial oversight in Canada , our Government will work with the provinces to put in place a common securities regulator.
Ensuring Sound Budgeting
Canada 's relative success in weathering the global economic turmoil thus far can be attributed in no small measure to our country's solid fiscal fundamentals, the best among all major industrialized countries.
A strong fiscal foundation is not an end in itself, but it is the bedrock on which a resilient economy is built. Responsible budgets, significant debt repayment, and declining corporate and personal income taxes have provided an important competitive advantage. As Canada navigates today's economic uncertainties, it is even more important that we keep our sights fixed on responsible fiscal management.
The Minister of Finance will provide details on our Government's approach to economic and fiscal management in the Economic and Fiscal Statement to be delivered next week.
Ongoing, unsustainable deficits are quite rightly unacceptable to Canadians. These structural deficits must never return. At the same time, in a historic global downturn, it would be misguided to commit to a balanced budget in the short term at any cost, because that cost would ultimately be borne by Canadian families.
Hard decisions will be needed to keep federal spending under control and focused on results. Grants, contributions and capital expenditures will be placed under the microscope of responsible spending. Departments will have the funding they need to deliver essential programs and services, and no more. Our Government will engage Parliament and encourage members to take a more active role in scrutinizing spending and suggesting areas for restraint.
Our Government is also committed to responsible fiscal management of public sector compensation, and will table legislation to ensure sustainable compensation growth in the federal Public Service.
Our Government will ensure that the provinces receive the generous transfer payments planned for health care and social programs. We will ensure that equalization payments also grow, but that they do not grow more quickly than our economy as a whole.
Any new measures to support the economy will also be carefully chosen and targeted for maximum benefit.
Securing Jobs for Families and Communities
Global turbulence is translating into real challenges for Canada . Our Government understands the pressures on ordinary hard-working Canadians and the businesses that provide them with jobs.
Canada 's economy will only remain as strong as its workers and families. Our Government will strengthen Canada 's workforce for the future by continuing to support student financial assistance and taking measures to encourage skilled trades and apprenticeships. Our Government will also work with the provinces to make the recognition of foreign credentials a priority, attract top international students to Canada and increase the uptake of immigrant settlement programs.
Our Government will also take steps to ensure that Aboriginal Canadians fully share in economic opportunities, putting particular emphasis on improving education for First Nations in partnership with the provinces and First Nations communities.
Our Government will support workers facing transition. It will ensure that existing programs and services are as effective as possible in meeting the needs of Canadians. Targeted help will be available to those who need it the most.
Our Government has already cut taxes to lower costs for business and help them compete and create jobs. To further reduce the cost pressures on Canadian business, our Government will take measures to encourage companies to invest in new machinery and equipment.
The Canadian manufacturing sector, particularly the automotive and aerospace industries, has been under increasing strain. Our Government will provide further support for these industries.
Canada 's traditional industries, such as fisheries, mining and forestry, sustain the economic well-being of many regions and communities. Our Government will continue to assist these industries through measures aimed at marketing Canadian products abroad and helping businesses to innovate.
Our Government will continue to support Canada 's farmers by ensuring freedom of choice for grain marketing in Western Canada and strongly supporting our supply-managed sectors at home and in international negotiations.
Public infrastructure is vital not only to create jobs for today, but also to create the links between communities and regions to help generate jobs for the future. Our Government is committed to expediting our Building Canada plan to ensure that projects are delivered as quickly as possible.
Expanding Investment and Trade
Canada 's prosperity depends not just on meeting the challenges of today, but on building the dynamic economy that will create opportunities and better jobs for Canadians in the future. As one of our greatest hockey legends has observed, we need ``to skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been.''
Building a more dynamic economy will require new ideas and new investment. Our Government understands that advances in science and technology are essential to strengthen the competitiveness of Canada 's economy. Our Government will start at home, working with industry to apply the best Canadian scientific and technological know-how to create innovative business solutions. It will invest in new world-class research facilities.
Our Government will also expand the opportunities for Canadian firms to benefit from foreign investment and knowledge, while taking steps to safeguard consumers and our national security. Our Government will proceed with legislation to modernize our competition and investment laws, implementing many of the recommendations of the Competition Policy Review Panel.
Cultural creativity and innovation are vital not only to a lively Canadian cultural life, but also to Canada 's economic future. Our Government will proceed with legislation to modernize Canada 's copyright laws and ensure stronger protection for intellectual property.
Both investment and trade matter to Canada 's prosperity. Our Government is committed to seeking out new opportunities for Canadians and to promoting global prosperity through free trade. It will work with the new administration in the United States in addressing shared challenges, especially during the current economic downturn, and seek opportunities to enhance North American competitiveness. New trade agreements will be pursued in Asia and the Americas , as well as with the European Union, to open markets for Canadian firms. Our Government will proceed with legislation to ratify the results of trade negotiations that have been concluded with the European Free Trade Association, Peru , Colombia and Jordan .
Our Government will continue to invest in expanding gateways on our Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and in vital border corridors such as the Detroit River International Crossing, to ensure that Canadian goods and services can reach markets in Europe, Asia and the United States .
Better positioning Canada to compete for investment and market opportunities will require action at home. A fragmented regulatory environment for internal trade and commerce has for too long restricted the flow of labour and investment across the country. Our Government will work with the provinces to remove barriers to internal trade, investment and labour mobility by 2010.
Making Government More Effective
Part of a solid economic and fiscal foundation is the sound management of government. To make Canada 's national government more effective, our Government is committed to reform and streamline the way it does business.
Our Government will pursue innovative reforms to the administration of programs and services, drawing on the successful experiences of other governments around the world. It will build partnerships with third parties and the private sector to deliver better services at a lower overall cost.
Our Government will review all program spending carefully to make sure that spending is as effective as possible and aligned with Canadians' priorities.
Our Government will cut the red tape faced by the private and not-for-profit sectors when doing business with the government.
Fixing procurement will be a top priority. Simpler and streamlined processes will make it easier for businesses to provide products and services to the government and will deliver better results for Canadians. Military procurement in particular is critical: Canada cannot afford to have cumbersome processes delay the purchase and delivery of equipment needed by our men and women in uniform.
Our Government will also strengthen and improve the management of Canada 's federal agencies, boards, commissions and Crown corporations to achieve greater cost-effectiveness and accountability.
Securing Our Energy Future
Energy is vitally important to our country. Our geography and climate mean that Canadians depend on affordable and reliable energy. The development of our rich energy resources is an important source of wealth and Canadian jobs.
Our Government will support the development of cleaner energy sources. The natural gas that lies beneath Canada 's North represents both an untapped source of clean fuel and an unequalled avenue to creating economic opportunities for northern people. Our Government will reduce regulatory and other barriers to extend the pipeline network into the North.
These measures will bring jobs to northern Canada and create employment across the country, just as they will bring new energy supplies to markets in southern Canada and throughout the world. Economic development in Canada 's North, led by a new stand-alone agency, is a key element of our Northern Strategy.
Nuclear energy is a proven technology, capable of reliable, large-scale output. In Canada and around the world, energy authorities are investing in nuclear power to meet both energy security and climate change goals. Our Government will ensure that Canada 's regulatory framework is ready to respond should the provinces choose to advance new nuclear projects.
Tackling Climate Change and Preserving Canada 's Environment
Our Government understands that Canada 's economic prosperity cannot be sustained without a healthy environment, just as environmental progress cannot be achieved without a healthy economy. Our Government will continue its realistic, responsible approach to addressing the challenge of climate change.
Our Government has committed to reducing Canada 's total greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020. We will meet this goal while also ensuring that Canada 's actions going forward remain comparable to what our partners in the United States , Europe and other industrialized countries undertake. We will work with the provincial governments and our partners to develop and implement a North America-wide cap and trade system for greenhouse gases and an effective international protocol for the post-2012 period.
To meet the challenge posed by climate change, we will also need to make greater use of technologies that do not emit greenhouse gases. Our Government will set an objective that 90 percent of Canada 's electricity needs be provided by non-emitting sources such as hydro, nuclear, clean coal or wind power by 2020. In support of this ambitious national goal, our Government will continue to provide support for biofuels, wind and other energy alternatives.
To ensure protection of our vital resources, our Government will bring in legislation to ban all bulk water transfers or exports from Canadian freshwater basins.
Our Government will work with all parties in Parliament to introduce sensible policies that can help consumers and improve our environmental well-being, such as increasing incentives for energy-saving home retrofits.
Helping All Canadians Participate
Canada is built on a promise of opportunity, the chance to work hard, raise a family and make a better life. Today, it is more important than ever to deliver on this promise, and ensure that all Canadians share in the promise of this land, regardless of cultural background, gender, age, disability or official language. This Government will break down barriers that prevent Canadians from reaching their potential.
Many working-age Canadians are faced with the dual pressure of holding down a job and caring for their family. Increasing numbers of Canadians are taking care of elderly parents while also raising young children. Our Government is committed to supporting working families and helping make ends meet.
Our Government will improve the Universal Child Care Benefit and take measures to increase access to maternity and parental benefits under Employment Insurance.
We will act to help families caring for loved ones with disabilities and to assist Canadians buying their first home.
Some Canadians face other barriers to participation in the economy and society, whether in the form of homelessness or debilitating illness. Our Government will extend the Homelessness Partnering Strategy and help more Canadians find affordable housing. It will take creative measures to tackle major heart, lung and neurological diseases and to build on the work of the Mental Health Commission.
Keeping Canadians Safe
In times of uncertainty as in times of prosperity, Canadians need to be assured that they are safe in their homes and communities.
Canadians look to governments to ensure that the justice system is working effectively and that Canadians are safe. Our Government will take tough action against crime and work with partners to improve the administration of justice. Serious offences will be met with serious penalties. Legal provisions will be strengthened in key areas, such as youth crime, organized crime and gang violence. Gun laws will be focused on ending smuggling and stronger penalties for gun crimes, not at criminalizing law-abiding firearms owners. More broadly, Canada 's criminal justice system will be made more efficient. Citizens need to know that justice is served, and that it is served swiftly.
Safety and security also mean that Canadians must be assured that the food on their dinner table, the toys they buy their children, and the medicines on which they rely are safe. Our Government will follow through with legislation providing better oversight of food, drug and consumer products. It will strengthen the power to recall products and increase penalties for violators. It will also move quickly to launch an independent investigation of this summer's listeria outbreak and act quickly upon its findings.
National security is the most fundamental duty of any national government to its citizens. Our Government will table a national security statement to explain how we intend to balance the new threats and challenges to national security that we face with the need for oversight, accountability and the protection of civil liberties.
Contributing to Global Security
Our national security depends on global security. Our Government believes that Canada 's aspirations for a better and more secure world must be matched by vigorous and concrete actions on the world stage.
Security ultimately depends upon a respect for freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Where these values are imperilled, the safety and prosperity of all nations are imperilled. Canada must have the capacity and willingness to stand for what is right, and to contribute to a better and safer world.
Our Government is transforming Canada 's engagement in Afghanistan to focus on reconstruction and development, and to prepare for the end of our military mission there in 2011. The hard work and heroic sacrifices of Canada 's men and women in the field—military, diplomatic and development—will leave the people of Afghanistan the lasting legacy of a more secure, more peaceful and better governed country.
Our Government will also continue to rebuild and arm the Canadian Forces with the best possible equipment. We will renew all of our major air, sea and surface fleets over the next two decades, creating new, high-technology jobs in Canada in the process.
Canada 's international assistance will continue to increase and will be spent more effectively in the promotion of development goals. A new, non-partisan democracy promotion agency will also be established to support the peaceful transition to democracy in repressive countries and help emerging democracies build strong institutions.
Building Stronger Institutions
Canada 's institutions are the cornerstone of our democracy, our freedom and our prosperity.
Parliament is Canada 's most important national institution. It is the only forum in which all Canadians, through their elected representatives, have a voice in the governance of the nation. Parliament should be an expression of our highest ideals and deepest values, our greatest hopes and grandest dreams for the future of our children. Our Government believes these ideals can only be achieved if Parliament truly reflects the character and aspirations of the Canadian people.
Our Government will introduce legislation to move toward representation by population in the House of Commons for Ontario , British Columbia and Alberta . Legislation will also be introduced to allow for nominees to the Senate to be selected by voters, to serve fixed terms of not longer than eight years, and for the Senate to be covered by the same ethics regime as the House of Commons.
The Public Service of Canada is a key national institution. Public servants inspect our food and police our borders. They deliver programs and services to millions of Canadians in every region of this country, from our largest cities to the most remote Arctic communities. Drawing on the recommendations of the Prime Minister's Advisory Committee on the Public Service, our Government is committed to the continued renewal of the public service.
Our Government will also take steps to strengthen the Canadian confederation. It will respect the jurisdiction of the provinces and territories and will enshrine its principles of federalism in a Charter of Open Federalism. The federal spending power will be constrained so that any new shared-cost program in an area of exclusive provincial responsibility will require the consent of the majority of the provinces to proceed, and that non-participating provinces can opt out with compensation, provided that they implement compatible programs or initiatives.
Conclusion
Canadians have renewed their confidence in our Government. They have placed their trust in their representatives. And they have asked us to work together to meet the challenges before our country.
Our Government is committed to Canada 's continued success at this time of global economic instability. All its energy will be directed to addressing the challenges Canadian families, businesses and workers face, both today and in the future. It will continue to establish effective policies that give a competitive advantage to this country. It will strengthen the institutions that keep Canadians safe, secure and prosperous. And it will work in partnership—with its allies, with the provinces and territories, with industry and with the millions of Canadian families—to keep Canada the true North, strong and free.
Canadians have faced times of uncertainty and renewal before and have always emerged a stronger and more united people. Gathered here in this Chamber, we remember the men and women who went before us and the legacy of freedom and prosperity that they have bequeathed to us. It is now our duty to protect and enhance this legacy for those who will follow us.
Honourable Members of the Senate and Commons, yours is a most important task. May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
47,40,2,2009-01-26,conservative,"Honourable Senators, Members of the House of Commons, Ladies and gentlemen,
In these uncertain times, when the world is threatened by a struggling economy, it is imperative that we work together, that we stand beside one another and that we strive for greater solidarity.
Today, in our democratic tradition, Canadians expect that their elected representatives will dedicate their efforts to ensure that Canada emerges stronger from this serious economic crisis.
Once again, the people�s representatives have gathered to consider the priorities of another parliamentary session.
Each Throne Speech is a milestone on the remarkable 142-year Canadian journey. Your predecessors, too, were summoned to this chamber at times of great crisis: as Canada struggled to claim her independence, in the shadow of war, during the depth of the Great Depression and at moments when great policy division tugged the very bonds of this union.
Today we meet at a time of unprecedented economic uncertainty. The global credit crunch has dragged the world economy into a crisis whose pull we cannot escape. The nations of the world are grappling with challenges that Canada can address but not avoid.
The Government�s agenda and the priorities of Parliament must adapt in response to the deepening crisis. Old assumptions must be tested and old decisions must be rethought. The global economy has weakened since Canadians voted in the last general election. In fact, it has weakened further since Parliament met last month.
Our Government has listened to Canadians who are concerned about how the worldwide recession is affecting their jobs, their savings and their communities. Our Government has reached out to Canadians in all regions, in all communities and from all walks of life. 
Our Government has consulted widely:
 
    with those who work, those who invest, those who create jobs, those who build infrastructure and those who provide non-profit services;
    with municipal, provincial and territorial governments, Aboriginal leaders and representatives of communities;
    in fact, with everyone whose input might help chart a course through the present storm.
Our Government approached the dialogue in a spirit of open and non-partisan cooperation. There is no monopoly on good ideas because we face this crisis together. There can be no pride of authorship�only the satisfaction of identifying solutions that will work for all Canadians. 
Acting on the constructive thoughts and suggestions that have been received, our Government will tomorrow present Canada �s economic stimulus plan. The plan will protect our economy from immediate threat, while making investments to promote long term growth.
The economic stimulus plan will be a plan of action.
 
    Our Government is stimulating the economy, both through direct government action and by encouraging private expenditure.
    Our Government is taking immediate action to build Canada through new investment in infrastructure.
    Our Government is acting to protect the stability of our financial system.
    Our Government is acting to ensure access to credit for businesses and consumers.
    Our Government is acting to support Canadian industries in difficulty?including forestry, manufacturing, automotive, tourism, agriculture?and to protect the families and communities who depend on those jobs.
    Our Government is acting to protect the vulnerable: the unemployed, lower-income Canadians, seniors, Aboriginal Canadians and others hit hardest by the global economic recession.
These actions will be targeted, they will inject immediate stimulus while promoting long-term growth and they will avoid a return to permanent deficits.
These actions will protect the jobs of today while readying our economy to create the jobs of tomorrow.
Canadians face a difficult year?perhaps several difficult years. In the face of such uncertainty, our Government has developed a clear and focused plan. Our Government will spend what is necessary to stimulate the economy, and invest what is necessary to protect our future prosperity.
As Canadians expect, the economy will be the focus of our Government's actions and of the measures placed before Parliament during the coming year. In pursuing measures to support the economy, our Government will also attend to the other important priorities that it set out in the Speech from the Throne to open the 40th Parliament.
The present crisis is new, but the imperative of concerted action is a challenge to which Parliament has risen many times in our history. What will sustain us today will be the same strengths of character that have pulled Canada through critical times before: unity, determination and constancy of purpose.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons:
As you unite in common effort and in common cause, may Divine Providence be your guide and inspiration."
48,40,3,2010-03-03,conservative,"Honourable Senators,
Members of the House of Commons,
Ladies and gentlemen,
We are a country whose citizens do not turn back when confronted by obstacles, whatever they are, and never shrink from lending a helping hand to the most disadvantaged, wherever they may be.
Though the effects of the global recession have not fully faded, Canadians are demonstrating a spirit of generosity that is a harbinger of hope to the people of Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, which has been shaken by a disaster of unprecedented scope.
The world we live in remains strong because of the ties of solidarity that we — women, men and young people — forge among ourselves and because of the care we show toward one another.
As the Vancouver Winter Olympics and upcoming Paralympics remind us, there are also circumstances when festive hearts and the sharing of a common humanity are our greatest hope.
I know Canadians will continue to care, and that spirit of solidarity will redefine their sense of sharing as efforts are made to support the economic recovery.
We gather for a new session of Parliament at a time of both great uncertainty and great optimism. Uncertainty because Canadians still feel the lingering effects of a recession that was not of their making. Optimism because our country has weathered the storm better than most and because Canadians over the past year have shown the world as never before both our capacity to care and our capability to act.
The agenda our Government laid before Parliament just over one year ago is largely in place. Through Canada's Economic Action Plan, our Government took decisive steps to protect incomes, create jobs, ease credit markets, and help workers and communities get back on their feet. As we begin to see modest improvements in growth and employment, the task before us today is to finish the work begun last year.
Jobs and growth remain the top priority. Our Government will complete the second year of Canada's Economic Action Plan — guided by extensive consultations with leaders in business, industry, and everyday working people and their families — and make refinements where necessary.
At the same time, Canada is poised to emerge from the recession powered by one of the strongest economies in the industrialized world. Therefore, our attention must also encompass the new measures Canada needs for success in the modern economy.
This will require a return to fiscal balance, securing the strong budgetary position that distinguishes our country from so many others.
While the task before us is great, the ingenuity, determination and compassion of Canadians are greater. We will ensure that Canada remains the best place in the world to raise a family. We will continue to stand up for those who built this great country. And we will forge ahead in building a Canada that is strong and united in a changing world.
Getting the Job Done: Completing Canada's Economic Action Plan
Canadians have confronted the challenges of the past year in the same way they have always met adversity — with pragmatism, resourcefulness and the spirit of partnership.
From the forest floor to the factory floor, Canadians have rallied in the face of the global recession. Businesses have found new ways to adapt to tighter credit and weaker markets. Workers have shared their jobs to spare colleagues from layoff. Many Canadians, out of work for the first time in their lives, have begun training for a new career. And households across the country have adjusted their finances to account for new realities.
Like Canadians themselves, governments across the country have adapted their approaches and joined together in a concerted effort to soften the impact of the recession.
Canada's Economic Action Plan is working. Tax cuts and enhanced Employment Insurance benefits are providing direct support to Canadians who paid into government programs over the years and now need help.
From coast to coast to coast, almost 16,000 projects are putting Canadians to work while laying the foundation for future prosperity. These projects range from roads and bridges to colleges and universities, from social housing to our cultural and heritage institutions.
Communities and industries most affected by the downturn are being supported. Businesses have begun hiring again, with the economy adding more than 135,000 net new jobs since July 2009. This has restored incomes, confidence and hope for the future for families across the country.
But even as confidence returns to our economy, it would be a mistake to declare that the recession is completely behind us. Too many Canadians still find themselves out of work and events beyond our borders could yet threaten a fragile recovery.
Our Government's top priority is therefore to complete the second year of Canada's Economic Action Plan and to continue creating jobs and growth. Our Government will work with its partners in the provinces and territories to make certain that projects are completed now and over the coming year, when the stimulus is most needed.
Our Government understands the real hardships experienced by Canadian families affected by job loss. Recognizing that unemployment continues to cast a long shadow over the recovery, our Government will continue to work on job creation and job protection. And it will help young Canadians looking to enter today's tough job market for the first time to make the transition to work.
Planning for Recovery: Returning to Fiscal Balance
Canadians understand that the events of the past year have required governments everywhere to run budgetary deficits. They also know that because our Government made the responsible choice to pay down debt in good economic times, Canada's debt levels remain by far the smallest in the G7. And they appreciate that this has allowed our country to enact one of the largest stimulus programs in the world without unduly burdening future generations.
At the same time, Canadians live within their means and expect their governments to do the same. Spending designed for a rainy day should not become an all-weather practice.
Canadians also realize that a balanced budget is not an end in itself, but the foundation of a strong and resilient economy. In taking responsible steps to reduce the deficit, our Government will not repeat the mistakes of the past.
Balancing the nation's books will not come at the expense of pensioners. It will not come by cutting transfer payments for health care and education or by raising taxes on hard-working Canadians. These are simply excuses for a federal government to avoid controlling spending.
Our Government's first step toward restoring fiscal balance will be to wind down stimulus spending as economic activity rebounds. It will work with its provincial, territorial and municipal partners to ensure that measures under Canada's Economic Action Plan come to an end by March 31, 2011. And as chair of the G8 and G20 this year, our Government will lead the call for a globally coordinated approach to the withdrawal of economic stimulus.
The second step toward restoring fiscal balance will be to restrain federal program spending overall, while protecting growth in transfers that directly benefit Canadians, such as pensions, health care and education.
    Our Government will lead by example, introducing legislation to freeze the salaries of the Prime Minister, Ministers, Members of Parliament and Senators.
     
    It will freeze the overall budget of Ministers' offices and calls on Members of both Houses of Parliament to do the same.
    It will freeze departmental operating budgets, that is, the total amount spent on salaries, administration and overhead.
     
    It will launch a review of administrative services to improve their efficiency and eliminate duplication.
     
    It will aggressively review all departmental spending to ensure value for money and tangible results.
     
    Our Government will also eliminate unnecessary appointments to federal agencies, boards, commissions and Crown corporations.
Building the Jobs and Industries of the Future
Industry and ingenuity have been the hallmarks of Canada's economy since the beginning. Aboriginal peoples, voyageurs and pioneers established the backbone of our modern trading nation. Immigrants armed only with dreams and determination travelled west to open the land that would become our breadbasket. Bright minds with bold ideas transformed sound and electricity into the communications network that links our world.
But today we face new challenges. Determined new competitors are rising. The relentless pace of technology means that every day there is something newer, faster, better. To succeed in the global economy, Canada must keep step as the world races forward.
Our strategy is clear: we must combine the best of our intellectual and natural resources to create jobs, growth and opportunity.
    The success of Canada's economy depends on a skilled and educated workforce. Through Canada's Economic Action Plan, our Government will continue to provide enhanced support for skills, apprenticeships and training for Canadian workers. It will make timely information on labour market opportunities available for all Canadians, especially in the area of the skilled trades. It will expand the opportunities for our top graduates to pursue post-doctoral studies and to commercialize their ideas.
     
    Our Government will also work hand-in-hand with Aboriginal communities and provinces and territories to reform and strengthen education, and to support student success and provide greater hope and opportunity.
    To fuel the ingenuity of Canada's best and brightest and bring innovative products to market, our Government will build on the unprecedented investments in Canada's Economic Action Plan by bolstering its Science and Technology Strategy. It will launch a digital economy strategy to drive the adoption of new technology across the economy. To encourage new ideas and protect the rights of Canadians whose research, development and artistic creativity contribute to Canada's prosperity, our Government will also strengthen laws governing intellectual property and copyright.
     
    Canada has been a spacefaring nation for nearly 50 years. Our Government will extend support for advanced research, development and prototyping of new space-based technologies, especially in support of Arctic sovereignty.
     
    Low taxes are already helping Canada attract the investment needed to turn ideas into products and services. Our Government will keep tax rates competitive and low, while taking aggressive steps to close unfair tax loopholes that allow a few businesses and individuals to take advantage of hard-working Canadians who pay their fair share.
    Our Government will open Canada's doors further to venture capital and to foreign investment in key sectors, including the satellite and telecommunications industries, giving Canadian firms access to the funds and expertise they need. While safeguarding Canada's national security, our Government will ensure that unnecessary regulation does not inhibit the growth of Canada's uranium mining industry by unduly restricting foreign investment. It will also expand investment promotion in key markets.
    Ensuring the broadest possible market for Canada's goods and services will require the aggressive pursuit of free trade. Our Government will implement free trade agreements with Peru and the European Free Trade Association and ask Parliament to ratify new agreements with Colombia, Jordan and Panama. Given the disappointing results of the Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations and the rapidly evolving global marketplace, our Government will aggressively diversify opportunities for Canadian business through bilateral trade agreements. It will continue trade negotiations with the European Union, India, the Republic of Korea, the Caribbean Community and other countries of the Americas. Building on the successful negotiation of new or expanded air agreements with 50 countries around the world, our Government will pursue additional agreements to achieve more competition, more choice for Canadians and more economic growth.
    Our Government will also build upon the recent agreement that gives Canadian companies permanent access to state and local government procurement in the United States.
Canada's strategy for economic success must leverage our considerable strengths, in particular our world-leading financial industry and energy resource endowment.
    The unique strength of Canada's financial industry set Canada apart during the global financial crisis. The World Economic Forum, among others, has recognized Canada's banking system as the strongest in the world. Our Government will build upon this advantage to make Canada an even stronger world financial centre. Recognizing the critical importance of sound securities regulation — both to attract investment and crack down on white-collar crime — our Government will act, within the ambit of the Constitution, to create a Canadian securities regulator.
     
    Our energy resource endowment provides Canada with an unparalleled economic advantage that we must leverage to secure our place as a clean energy superpower and a leader in green job creation. We are the world's seventh largest crude oil producer with the second largest proven reserves. We are the third largest natural gas producer, the third largest hydroelectric generator, the largest producer of uranium, and by far the largest supplier of energy resources to the world's largest marketplace. To support responsible development of Canada's energy and mineral resources, our Government will untangle the daunting maze of regulations that needlessly complicates project approvals, replacing it with simpler, clearer processes that offer improved environmental protection and greater certainty to industry.
     
    Our Government will continue to invest in clean energy technologies. It will review energy-efficiency and emissions-reduction programs to ensure they are effective. And it will position Canada's nuclear industry to capitalize on the opportunities of the global nuclear renaissance — beginning with the restructuring of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited.
Finally, our strategy for the economy must create the conditions for continued success in the industries that are the foundation for Canada's prosperity and support thousands of communities, both rural and urban.
    Our Government will partner with the forest industry to enter new markets and deploy new technologies, while respecting the Softwood Lumber Agreement with the United States.
    It will introduce new legislation to reform Canada's outdated system of fisheries management.
     
    It will take steps to support a competitive livestock industry and pursue market access for agricultural products. Our Government will also ensure the freedom of choice for which Western barley farmers overwhelmingly voted, and it will continue to defend supply management of dairy and poultry products.
    Small and medium-sized businesses are the engines of the Canadian economy, responsible for the creation of most new jobs. To support them, our Government will continue to identify and remove unnecessary, job-killing regulation and barriers to growth.
    It will take further steps to support the competitiveness of Canadian manufacturers. And recognizing the strategic importance of a strong domestic shipbuilding industry, it will continue to support the industry's sustainable development through a long-term approach to federal procurement.
     
    Our Government will also explore ways to better protect workers when their employers go bankrupt.
Making Canada the Best Place for Families
Regardless of profession or trade, of industry or region, Canadians have always striven toward a common objective — to make a home and nurture a family. For many Canadians, there can be no greater accomplishment than to provide for their children, to contribute to the local community, and to live in a safe and secure country. Our Government shares and supports these aspirations.
To help Canadian families to balance work and family life, our Government introduced the Universal Child Care Benefit to provide $100 per month for each child under the age of six. This is direct financial support to working families that gives them the freedom to choose the best child care for them. Our Government will strengthen this benefit for sole-support, single-parent families.
Protecting the health and safety of Canadians and their families is a priority of our Government. This commitment was reflected in its decision to secure the H1N1 vaccine for every Canadian. To assure parents that their children's food, medicine and toys are safe, our Government will reintroduce legislation to protect Canadian families from unsafe food, drug and consumer products. Our Government will respect the wishes of Canadians by reintroducing the consumer product safety legislation in its original form.
Our Government will continue to strengthen Canada's food safety system.
It will ensure that families have the information they need to make informed choices and it will hold those who produce, import and sell goods in Canada accountable for the safety of Canadians.
To prevent accidents that harm our children and youth, our Government will also work in partnership with non-governmental organizations to launch a national strategy on childhood injury prevention.
Just as we know that parents are in the best position to make decisions for their families, the best solutions to the diverse challenges confronting Canada's communities are often found locally. Every day, the power of innovation is seen at work in communities across this country, as citizens, businesses and charitable groups join forces to tackle local problems.
Too often, however, grassroots efforts are hobbled by red tape. Too often, local solutions are denied access to government assistance because they do not fit the bureaucratic definition of the problem. Too often, the efforts of communities falter not on account of a lack of effort or heart, but because of a lack of expertise to turn good ideas into reality.
    Our Government will take steps to support communities in their efforts to tackle local challenges.
     
    It will look to innovative charities and forward-thinking private-sector companies to partner on new approaches to many social challenges.
     
    To recognize the enormous contribution volunteers make to Canada, our Government will also establish a prime ministerial award for volunteerism.
Our communities are built on the rule of law, the cornerstone of peace, order and good government. The law must protect everyone, and those who commit crimes must be held to account. Canadians want a justice system that delivers justice. We know we can protect ourselves without compromising the values that define our country.
Our Government acted decisively to crack down on crime and ensure the safety and security of our neighbourhoods and communities. It introduced laws mandating prison sentences for gun crimes, toughening sentencing for dangerous criminals, raising to 16 from 14 the age of protection from adult sexual predators, and ensuring that criminals serve sentences that reflect the severity of their crimes.
Our Government will now focus on the further protection of children, women and victims of white-collar crime.
    It will protect the most vulnerable members of society: our children. It will introduce legislation to increase the penalties for sexual offences against children as well as legislation to strengthen the sex offender registry. It will protect children from Internet luring and cyber abuse.
    Our Government will also ensure the youth criminal justice system responds strongly to those few who commit serious and violent crimes, while focusing on the rehabilitation of all young offenders.
     
    Our Government will propose laws ensuring that for multiple murderers, life means life and requiring that violent offenders serve their time in jail, not in the luxury of home. It will reintroduce tough legislation to combat the organized criminal drug trade. Our Government will respect the will of Canadians by reintroducing this legislation in its original form.
     
    Our Government will take additional action to address the disturbing number of unsolved cases of murdered and missing Aboriginal women. The Sisters in Spirit initiative has drawn particular attention to this pressing criminal justice priority.
    Our Government will also introduce legislation to crack down on white-collar crime and secure justice for victims through tougher sentences. Hard-working Canadians who entrust their retirement savings to others have a right to see that trust honoured.
Justice must be effective, swift and true. It must also be fair to victims of crime.
    To ensure justice is effective, our Government will introduce legislation to give police investigative powers for the 21st century. Canada's police officers and chiefs have asked for these vital tools to stay ahead of the tactics adopted by today's criminals.
     
    To ensure justice is delivered swiftly, our Government will introduce legislation to improve criminal procedures to cut the number of long, drawn-out trials.
    Our Government will also offer tangible support to innocent victims of crime and their families. It will give families of murder victims access to special benefits under Employment Insurance. It will introduce legislation to give employees of federally regulated industries the right to unpaid leave if they or members of their families are victimized by crime. And our Government will introduce legislation to make the victim surcharge mandatory, to better fund victim services.
Just as criminals threaten Canadians' personal safety, terrorists threaten our country's security. Our peaceful, prosperous and pluralistic society is one of the safest places in the world to live. Yet Canada faces real, significant and shifting threats. Our Government will take steps to safeguard Canada's national security.
    It will make travel by air safer by employing the latest screening practices and detection technologies for passengers and cargo. While the costs of air security must be borne by businesses and individuals who use air transport, our Government will ensure their contribution is invested responsibly and effectively, and delivers measurable results.
     
    It will introduce a new biometric passport that will significantly improve security.
     
    It will modernize the judicial tools employed to fight terrorism and organized crime.
     
    Working with provinces, territories and the private sector, our Government will implement a cyber-security strategy to protect our digital infrastructure.
Standing Up for Those Who Helped Build Canada
Canadians believe sacrifice and hard work should be recognized. As we strive to create an even better future for our families and communities, our Government will stand up for those who built and defended this country.
Superior health care and quality of life mean that Canadians now enjoy one of the longest life expectancies in the world. As more and more Canadians enter their golden years, our Government will seek to enhance their well-being during the retirement that they have earned. This demographic shift poses a challenge to the sustainability of our social programs and our economy. Our Government will meet the demands of the aging population.
Our Government has taken numerous measures to assure our senior citizens that Canada's retirement income system is the strongest in the world. Among other measures, our Government has introduced Tax Free Savings Accounts and income splitting for Canada's pensioners.
    To support seniors and those planning for retirement, our Government will continue to work with the provinces and territories on options to further strengthen Canada's retirement income system.
     
    In recognition of the contributions seniors make to society, our Government will support legislation establishing Seniors Day.
Just as generations of Canadians worked on the home front to build this great country, so too have generations of veterans fought to defend Canada and Canadian values around the world. We are reminded of the bravery and sacrifice of those who serve in our Armed Forces as we celebrate this year's centenary of the Royal Canadian Navy and as we mark the passing of John Henry Foster Babcock, the last surviving Canadian veteran of World War I. A national day of commemoration will be held on Vimy Ridge Day, April 9, to celebrate the contribution his generation made to the cause of freedom.
Today, however, a new generation of men and women in uniform continues to stand up for the values and principles Canadians hold dear. In Afghanistan, the Canadian Forces prepare for the end of the military mission in 2011 with the knowledge that — through great sacrifice and with great distinction — their efforts saved Kandahar province from falling back under Taliban control. After 2011, our effort in Afghanistan will focus on development and humanitarian aid.
In Haiti, the Canadian Forces have taken the lessons learned in Afghanistan and put them to use in very different circumstances. Their speed and effectiveness in deployment were and are unsurpassed in the world.
To serve Canada in the profession of arms is an extraordinary and honourable acceptance of risks, many of which cannot be foreseen, and all of which may have profound personal consequences for those who assume them. Our Government has supported our men and women in uniform not only in words, but by making the investments necessary to rebuild Canada's military. Our Government will continue to stand up for our military and our veterans.
    Our Government will change the unfair rules restricting access to benefits under Employment Insurance for military families who have paid into the system for years.
     
    To further commemorate the sacrifices of our armed forces, our Government will bring individuals, groups and businesses together to build community war memorials.
     
    Our Government has established the New Veterans Charter and an ombudsman, expanded the Veterans Independence Program and, in recognition of the gallant service of Allied veterans who fought alongside Canadian troops during the Second World War and the Korean War, reinstated benefits under the War Veterans Allowance Act. Our Government will continue to modernize support systems for Canadian veterans.
Honouring those who built this country includes recognizing the contribution of those who make their living on the land and the realities of rural life in Canada. Our Government will continue to support legislation to repeal the wasteful and ineffective long-gun registry that targets law-abiding farmers and hunters, not criminals.
Our Government also recognizes the contributions of Canada's Aboriginal people. Too often, their stories have been ones of sorrow. Our Government will continue to build on its historic apology for the treatment of children in residential schools.
    After settling 17 specific claims since this Parliament began, it will continue to work to resolve additional claims.
    Having made safe drinking water and effective waste-water treatment on-reserve a national priority, our Government will introduce new legislative measures to further this goal.
    It is only 50 years ago that Aboriginal people in Canada were granted the right to vote. To further protect the rights of Aboriginal people, particularly women living on-reserve, our Government will take steps to ensure the equitable distribution of real property assets in the event of death, divorce or separation. It will also introduce legislation to comply with a recent court decision in order to address gender inequality under the Indian Act.
Strengthening a United Canada in a Changing World
Our values as Canadians are rooted in our history and in our institutions. Our parliamentary democracy, which brought together people of many lands, faiths and languages to live in harmony. Our federal system, which recognizes our differences, while advancing our unity. Our official languages. Our northern landscape.
We are a country whose story is still being written. Last month, Canadians took pride in the inspired performances of our Olympic athletes at the Winter Games in Vancouver and cheered when Alexandre Bilodeau won our first-ever Olympic gold medal on our own soil. But our athletes did not stop at just one. They surpassed the record for the most gold medals ever won at a Winter Olympics. We are proud of our medallists and the entire Canadian Olympic team. Next week, the Paralympic Games will officially begin and again we will cheer as our athletes take on the world. Our Government will continue to invest in world-class Canadian athletics.
A shared understanding of Canadian history unites us as citizens. Two years ago, we celebrated the 400th anniversary of the founding of Quebec City. This year we mark the quadricentenary of the settling of Cupids, Newfoundland and Labrador. Two years hence, our Government will engage millions of citizens and strengthen knowledge and pride in Canada by commemorating the bicentennial of the War of 1812, an event that was key to shaping our identity as Canadians and ultimately our existence as a country. That year Canadians will also celebrate the 60th anniversary of the accession of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, and our Government has established a Diamond Jubilee Committee to prepare for this historic occasion. Our Government will also ask Parliament to examine the original gender-neutral English wording of the national anthem.
We are a country founded on democracy. Our shared values and experiences must be reflected in our national institutions, starting with Parliament. To reflect the growing number of Canadians living in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta, our Government will follow through on its commitment to address their under-representation, consistent with the fundamental, democratic, constitutional principle of representation by population in the House of Commons. It will propose legislation to increase voter participation by expanding advance voting in elections. Our Government also remains committed to Senate reform and will continue to pursue measures to make the upper chamber more democratic, effective and accountable.
Our Government recognizes the Public Service of Canada as a critical national institution. Our Government will continue to support the renewal of the Public Service and ensure it is ready for the changes required by the aging of its own and the wider Canadian labour force.
We are a bilingual country. Canada's two official languages are an integral part of our history and position us uniquely in the world. Building on the recognition that the Québécois form a nation within a united Canada, and the Roadmap for Canada's Linguistic Duality, our Government will take steps to strengthen further Canada's francophone identity. It will also continue to respect provincial jurisdiction and to restrict the use of the federal spending power.
We are a country with an Aboriginal heritage. A growing number of states have given qualified recognition to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Our Government will take steps to endorse this aspirational document in a manner fully consistent with Canada's Constitution and laws.
We are a country of immigrants. Our identities are bound up in the stories of ancestors from hundreds of lands. To share these stories, our Government will introduce legislation to establish Pier 21 in Halifax — the site where so many began their Canadian journey — as Canada's National Museum of Immigration. It will continue to work with the provinces to strengthen recognition of foreign credentials through the Pan-Canadian Framework for the Assessment and Recognition of Foreign Qualifications. To better protect would-be immigrants, our Government will take steps to shut down unscrupulous immigration consultants. Our Government will also introduce legislation to speed up the revocation of citizenship of those who have concealed their war crimes.
We are a country of refuge. For those victimized by disaster in their homeland or facing persecution by their own governments, Canada is a beacon. When disaster struck in Haiti, our Government accelerated the adoption process for Haitian orphans. And it is allowing Haitians temporarily in Canada to extend their stays. To remove the years of uncertainty often faced by refugees in genuine need, while closing off avenues for those simply seeking a back door into the country, our Government will propose comprehensive reforms to the refugee system. It supports the establishment of a National Monument to the Victims of Communism and it will support legislation to establish a national Holocaust memorial.
We are a northern country. Canadians are deeply influenced by the vast expanse of our Arctic and its history and legends. Our Government established the Northern Strategy to realize the potential of Canada's North for northerners and all Canadians.
    It will create a world-class High Arctic Research Station.
     
    The Joint Review Panel on the Mackenzie Gas Project has completed its report. Our Government will reform the northern regulatory regime to ensure that the region's resource potential can be developed where commercially viable while ensuring a better process for protecting our environment.
    It will continue to give northerners a greater say over their own future and take further steps toward territorial devolution.
     
    Our Government will continue to vigorously defend Canada's Arctic sovereignty. It will continue to map our northern resources and waters. It will take action to increase marine safety and reduce pollution from shipping and other maritime traffic.
     
    Our Government will also work with other northern countries to settle boundary disagreements.
We are a country of unparalleled natural beauty. To further protect and preserve the diversity and health of our natural environment, our Government will bolster its Action Plan on Clean Water. And it will build on the creation of more than 85,000 square kilometres of national parks and marine conservation areas as part of its national conservation plan.
We are a country that stands up for what is right in the world. Canadians want their Government to do what is right, not what is popular. They want their country to carry its share of the work in international affairs, not just talk about it. And they want their Government to make only those commitments it intends to keep.
In the debate among nations, our Government will pursue a foreign policy that responds to changing times but remains anchored in Canadian values and an enlightened view of sovereignty that recognizes that national interests are often interconnected.
    Through our leadership this year of the North American, G8 and G20 summits, our Government will advocate greater investment in maternal and child health in developing countries. It will continue to push for stronger financial market regulation, modelled after Canada's world-leading practices. And it will oppose trade protectionism in all its guises.
     
    Our Government will use its voice to speak on behalf of Canada's commitment to global security and human rights.
     
    Recognizing the danger posed by the proliferation of nuclear materials and technology to global peace and security, our Government will support the initiatives of President Obama and participate fully in the landmark Nuclear Security Summit in Washington in April.
Nowhere is a commitment to principled policy, backed by action, needed more than in addressing climate change. Our Government has advocated for an agreement that includes all the world's major greenhouse gas emitters, for that is the only way to actually reduce global emissions. And it has pursued a balanced approach to emissions reduction that recognizes the importance of greening the economy for tomorrow and protecting jobs today.
The Copenhagen Accord reflects these principles and is fully supported by the Government of Canada. Together with other industrialized countries, Canada will provide funding to help developing economies reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change. Here at home, our Government will continue to take steps to fight climate change by leading the world in clean electricity generation. And recognizing our integrated continental economic links, our Government will work to reduce emissions through the Canada-U.S. clean energy dialogue launched last year with President Obama's administration.
Conclusion
Honourable Members of the Senate and Members of the Commons, you are charged with a most important task — to give voice to the values, concerns and aspirations of Canadians.
This is a year when the eyes of the world are on Canada.
A year in which our athletes are excelling here at home at the Olympic and Paralympic Games.
A year in which Canada will host world leaders at the North American, G8 and G20 summits.
A year in which Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will celebrate Canada Day with Canadians.
A year in which Canadians are leading the way in humanitarian efforts in Haiti, just as they are standing for freedom — at great cost — in Afghanistan.
And it is a year during which the Canadian economy is emerging from recession as one of the strongest and most resilient in the developed world.
These are all things of which Canadians can be justifiably proud.
They remind every Canadian that our citizenship is more than a contract to pay taxes in exchange for government services. To be Canadian is to show the world that people drawn from every nation can live in harmony. To seek peace, but stand on guard for rights, democracy and the rule of law. To be resolute in confronting a global crisis and ambitious in planning for a more prosperous future.
The future to which Canadians aspire will not arrive by chance. Grand visions for a nation's future will come to nothing if not balanced by the means to pay for them. To realize the hopes Canadians hold for themselves and their families, the economy must remain our Government's single most urgent priority. Hope is borne on the wings of prosperity.
That is why tomorrow our Government will present a budget focused on jobs and growth — now and for the future.
Honourable Members, let us join together to build a stronger Canada and a stronger economy.
As you set about this vital work, I pray that Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
49,41,1,2011-06-03,conservative,"Honourable Senators,
Members of the House of Commons,
Ladies and gentlemen,
I begin by congratulating all parliamentarians on this opening day of the Forty-first Parliament of Canada on my own behalf and on behalf of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, who sends her congratulations and warm good wishes. Many of you are returning to your duties as Members of the House of Commons, and over one hundred of you are about to take your places as elected representatives for the first time.
Together, you have been entrusted with a profound responsibility: to serve the public interest on behalf of all Canadians.
In the months since my installation as Governor General, I have had the privilege of meeting with Canadians in their communities, and at Rideau Hall and La Citadelle. It has been an honour to answer this unique call to service, and I want to share with you something of what I have learned in my travels across this remarkable country of ours.
I have learned that, regardless of age or affiliation, all Canadians want to help create a better future for this country. Each of us aspires to a Canada where everyone can succeed and contribute, where excellence and opportunity coexist.
I have met with Canadians from all walks of life and discovered this common ground.
In 2017, we will celebrate the 150th anniversary of Confederation, and I invite all Canadians to imagine ways to build a smarter, more caring nation as we approach this wonderful milestone. I believe that in order to achieve our vision, we must work together to support families and children, to reinforce learning and innovation, and to encourage philanthropy and volunteerism.
Each of us can answer the call to service in our own way and, together, continue this bold experiment that we call Canada.
Canadians have expressed their desire for a strong, stable national government in this new Parliament. With this clear mandate, our Government will deliver on its commitments. It will implement the next phase of Canada’s Economic Action Plan to build on the progress already made. It will continue to focus on jobs and growth. It will bring the federal budget back into balance. It will invest in our system of universal health care. It will support the communities and families that work so hard to care for each other. Our Government will defend the rights of law-abiding citizens, and it will promote Canadian values and interests at home and abroad.
Our Government will be here for all Canadians—for individuals, for families and for all regions of the country—as together we move Canada forward.
Here for jobs and growth
Jobs and growth will remain our Government’s top priority.
Through Canada’s Economic Action Plan, our Government took direct action to create jobs and protect Canadians during the global recession. On Monday, as our first order of business, our Government will reintroduce our Budget, in order to implement the next phase of Canada’s Economic Action Plan—our low tax plan for jobs and growth. We will get back to work on the things that matter most to Canadians: good jobs, security for our families and a prosperous future.
Our Government’s plan builds on five years of hard work to create the right conditions for growth and job creation: a stable, predictable, low-tax environment; a highly skilled and flexible workforce; support for innovation and new technologies; and wider access to markets abroad. This approach has allowed Canada to meet the challenges of the global recession. The next phase of our Government’s plan is designed to help us stay on track during the recovery.
Since 2006, Canadians have benefited from significant, broad-based tax cuts. These cuts have given families the flexibility to make the choices that are right for them. They have freed businesses to grow and succeed, creating the jobs on which Canadians depend. Our Government will continue on this path by introducing new tax credits for individuals and families, and by keeping taxes low to create jobs. It will also complete work already underway with the Government of Quebec to reach an agreement on tax harmonization no later than September 15, 2011.
However, there is more to be done. The global economy remains fragile, and risks to our recovery persist. As well, Canada’s workforce is aging, and it will no longer grow as it has in the past. This demographic challenge will impact our economic future and put long-term pressures on our pension and health systems that must be addressed.
In the years ahead, our prosperity will also depend on making sure that all Canadians have the skills and opportunities to contribute, to innovate and to succeed. Our Government’s plan will provide assistance for workers who want to learn new skills and seize opportunities. It will remove barriers for older workers who want to continue their careers. It will lay the foundation for long-term growth by helping a new generation gain the critical skills they will need to thrive in the workforce.
The success of Canada’s job-creating businesses demands both hard work and good ideas, and we must create the right conditions for both to be rewarded. Our Government will introduce and seek swift passage of copyright legislation that balances the needs of creators and users.
In order to improve Canada’s productivity, enhance our economic competitiveness and increase our standard of living, our Government will continue to make targeted investments to promote and encourage research and development in Canada's private sector and in our universities, colleges and polytechnics. It will look for ways to support innovation while ensuring that federal investment in research and development is effective and maximizes results for Canadians. It will also release and implement a Digital Economy Strategy that enhances digital infrastructure and encourages Canadian businesses to adopt digital technologies and provide digital-skills training for their employees and new hires.
In addition, our Government will continue to cut red tape for small businesses so that they can focus their attention on growing their businesses and creating jobs. This will be achieved while maintaining the highest standards to protect our environment and the health and safety of Canadians.
Our Government will also continue opening new markets for Canadian businesses in order to create good new jobs for Canadian workers. Since 2006, we have signed free trade agreements covering eight countries, and negotiations covering some fifty more are underway.
Our Government will aim to complete negotiations on a free trade agreement with the European Union by 2012. It will also seek to complete negotiations on a free trade agreement with India in 2013. In all international forums and bilateral negotiations, our Government will continue to stand up for Canadian farmers and industries by defending supply management.
The United States is our most important trading partner, ally and friend. Our Government will work with President Obama and his administration to deliver on the Shared Vision for Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness. We will strengthen our collaboration to streamline and secure our border and enhance regulatory cooperation, ensuring that people and goods can flow freely and safely between our two countries.
Our Government also understands the importance of attracting foreign investment to our economy. Foreign investment helps Canadian companies grow by introducing new technologies and practices—launching pads to strengthen growth and innovation here at home. It provides new opportunities to connect our firms to the world. Our Government will continue to welcome foreign investment that benefits Canada.
Our Government will also move forward with willing partners to establish a new national securities regulator, subject to the Supreme Court’s decision on the extent of federal jurisdiction.
Here to eliminate the deficit
Nearly three years ago, the world faced an unprecedented financial crisis. Drawing on strong fundamentals and the values of the hard-working Canadians and firms that refused to let difficult times define them, our Economic Action Plan helped Canada emerge quickly from recession. Working closely with provinces, territories and communities, our Government moved swiftly to deliver a targeted, time-limited stimulus program that created and protected jobs right across the country.
Hard work, determination and responsible choices allowed us to make these extraordinary investments when times were tough, while avoiding the high debt levels that threaten other countries. We must now take that same approach to future growth. We must eliminate the deficit and return to balanced budgets to ensure that our economy can continue to grow and create jobs and that the federal government will have sufficient fiscal flexibility for future choices.
Our Government had committed to achieving this by 2015. In order to accelerate the return to a balanced budget and to eliminate the deficit one year earlier, over the next year we will undertake a Strategic and Operating Review of government spending led by a new Cabinet subcommittee established for this purpose. This review will be focused on reducing the cost of government, while keeping taxes low and preserving transfers to individuals and provinces for essential things like pensions, health and education. Our Government will also complete its stimulus package as promised and continue specific measures to restrain the growth of government expenditures.
Our Government’s plan will put us on a strong footing to resume paying down the federal debt, further reduce taxes on families and continue investing in priorities.
Here for hard-working families
There is no greater priority for Canadians than caring for their loved ones. Canadians believe that their parents and grandparents have worked hard and deserve a secure retirement. They want their children and grandchildren to grow up with every opportunity to lead happy, healthy lives.
Many Canadian families struggle to realize these goals. That is why our Government’s low-tax plan will permanently enhance the Guaranteed Income Supplement for some 680,000 of Canada’s most vulnerable seniors. This increase—the largest in a quarter century—will help these seniors make ends meet. At the same time, our Government will continue to help Canadians save for their retirement, and will work with provincial and territorial partners to implement the Pooled Registered Pension Plan.
Our Government’s plan also recognizes the tremendous time and resources required of family caregivers. Many individuals and families have added responsibilities in caring for infirm parents or relatives. These family caregivers make special sacrifices, often leaving the workforce temporarily and forgoing employment income.
The new Family Caregiver Tax Credit will support those who care for a dependent family member who is infirm. In addition, our Government will remove the cap on eligible expenses that caregivers can claim under the Medical Expense Tax Credit.
Our Government will also support parents in providing their children with opportunities to grow personally and discover their creative passions by establishing a Children’s Arts Tax Credit.
Canadians want and expect their health care system to be there when they and their families need it most. Canadians want better results from the health care system, at the same time as an aging population is putting unprecedented pressure on the system’s ability to deliver.
Our Government is committed to respecting provincial jurisdiction and working with the provinces and territories to ensure that the health care system is sustainable and that there is accountability for results. It will maintain the six percent escalator for the Canada Health Transfer, while working collaboratively with provincial partners to renew the Health Accord and to continue reducing wait times. As has been done before, our Government will enter into a separate agreement with the Government of Quebec regarding the implementation of the renewed Health Accord.
Here to stand on guard for Canada
Canadians are united by core values, a shared history and a sense of common purpose. Our Government will join Canadians in celebrating our heritage, in promoting our values and in standing for what is right on the world stage. In an uncertain global environment, our Government will also continue to pursue a stable, principled foreign policy that advances Canada’s interests.
The Canadian Armed Forces play a crucial role in defending our sovereignty and national security. As the Canadian mission in Afghanistan transitions to training, diplomacy and development, our Government joins Canadians in honouring those who gave their lives and in recognizing the sacrifice and achievements of all the men and women, both military and civilian, who have served and continue to serve in Afghanistan. Our Government will continue to recognize and support all veterans.
Today, as North Africa and the Middle East are being transformed by their people, the Canadian Armed Forces are standing tall with our allies to protect civilians in Libya. Our Government will hold a parliamentary debate on the future of this important mission.
As part of our ongoing efforts to promote human rights, our Government will create a new Office of Religious Freedom to help protect religious minorities and to promote the pluralism that is essential to the development of free and democratic societies.
We will also take action to strengthen our national sovereignty. Our Government is committed to protecting the integrity of our immigration system. It will introduce measures to address marriage fraud—an abuse of our system that can victimize unsuspecting Canadians and vulnerable immigrants. Our Government will also reintroduce legislation to combat human smuggling, which can place migrants in dangerous conditions and undermine trust in Canada’s immigration system.
Our Government has made Canada’s North a cornerstone of its agenda. The strongest expression of our sovereignty comes through presence and actions, not words. Our Government will continue to exercise leadership in the stewardship of northern lands and waters. It is also committed to working with the Northwest Territories and the private sector to complete the Dempster Highway—by linking Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk—thereby realizing Prime Minister Diefenbaker’s vision of connecting Canada by road from sea to sea to sea.
Canada’s natural environment shapes our national identity, our health and our prosperity. Our Government has expanded protected lands and marine areas to an unprecedented extent, so that current and future generations can continue to enjoy them. In this, the 100th anniversary year of our national parks system, our Government will create significant new protected areas. It will work with provincial, regional, municipal, Aboriginal and community stakeholders toward establishing an urban national park in the Rouge Valley of eastern Toronto. Looking to the future, our Government will engage a broad range of stakeholders on the development of a National Conservation Plan, to move our conservation objectives forward and better connect all Canadians with nature.
Our Government is committed to developing Canada’s extraordinary resource wealth in a way that protects the environment. It will support major new clean energy projects of national or regional significance, such as the planned Lower Churchill hydroelectricity project in Atlantic Canada. It will engage the provinces, territories and industry on ways to improve the regulatory and environmental assessment process for resource projects, while ensuring meaningful consultation with affected communities, including Aboriginal communities.
Beyond our natural heritage, Canadians also cherish our shared history. Anniversaries are an important part of how a society marks its collective progress and defines its goals for the future. A key milestone next year will be the bicentennial of the War of 1812. We will remember how those of diverse backgrounds and various regions came together to fight for Canada, ensuring the independent destiny of our country in North America. We will also celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Selkirk Settlement, which marks the founding of Manitoba and the early days of the modern West.
Next year we will observe Her Majesty’s Diamond Jubilee, celebrating her six decades of service as Queen of Canada. And Canadians look forward, in just a few weeks’ time, to welcoming Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their first Royal Tour since their marriage this spring.
Here for law-abiding Canadians
The Government of Canada has no more fundamental duty than to protect the personal safety of our citizens and defend against threats to our national security.
Our Government will move quickly to reintroduce comprehensive law-and-order legislation to combat crime and terrorism. These measures will protect children from sex offenders. They will eliminate house arrest and pardons for serious crimes. They will give law enforcement officials, courts and victims the legal tools they need to fight criminals and terrorists. Our Government will continue to protect the most vulnerable in society and work to prevent crime. It will propose tougher sentences for those who abuse seniors and will help at risk youth avoid gangs and criminal activity. It will address the problem of violence against women and girls.
Our Government has always believed the interests of law-abiding citizens should be placed ahead of those of criminals. Canadians who are victimized or threatened by crime deserve their government’s support and protection, and they should have the right to take reasonable steps to defend themselves and their property when the police cannot be there to assist them. Our Government will reintroduce legislation to clarify and strengthen laws on self-defence, defence of property and citizen’s arrest.
Our Government will also continue to implement its response to the Air India Report.
Here for communities and industries
In addition to guarding the interests of our nation as a whole, our Government will continue taking action to address the needs and aspirations of every region of the country. Local communities are best placed to overcome their unique challenges, but government can help create the conditions for these communities—and the industries that sustain them—to succeed.
Canada’s rural communities are rich in history and culture, and generations of rural Canadians have worked hard and played by the rules. They should not be the target of unfair laws. Our Government will act on its promise to introduce legislation to end the wasteful and ineffective long-gun registry.
Canada’s traditional industries remain crucial to our economy. Our Government has always stood behind Canada’s agricultural, forestry, fishing, mineral, manufacturing and energy sectors—and will continue to support them as they innovate and grow. It will also introduce legislation to ensure that western farmers have the freedom to sell wheat and barley on the open market.
Canada’s Aboriginal peoples are central to Canada’s history, and our Government has made it a priority to renew and deepen our relationship. The contribution of Canada’s Aboriginal peoples will be important to our future prosperity. Concerted action is needed to address the barriers to social and economic participation that many Aboriginal Canadians face.
Our Government will work with Aboriginal communities, provinces and territories to meet this challenge. It will help open the door to greater economic development by providing new investments in First Nations Land Management. It will promote access to clean water and the deployment of clean energy technology in Aboriginal and northern communities.
Building on the work of the National Panel on First Nation Elementary and Secondary Education, our Government will engage with partners to make concrete, positive changes to give First Nations children a better education so that they can realize their dreams. We will also expand adult basic education programming in the territories to help to increase education and employment levels.
Our Government will also introduce legislation to ensure that people living on reserve have the same matrimonial real property rights and protections as other Canadians.
Canada’s diverse communities are connected by shared values and aspirations, and by the willingness to lend a hand. This has been markedly evident in the response of ordinary Canadians to recent and devastating floods and wildfires. Our Government recognizes the resolve and courage shown by Canadian communities in the face of adversity and will stand by them in their times of need.
Here for integrity and accountability
In these and all other measures our Government will pursue, we will provide the principled, accountable leadership and good, clean government that Canadians deserve. On first taking office, our Government introduced major new accountability legislation as its first act in the Thirty-ninth Parliament, and it will now move forward on its long-standing commitment to democratic reform.
Reform of the Senate remains a priority for our Government. Our Government will reintroduce legislation to limit term lengths and to encourage provinces and territories to hold elections for Senate nominees.
Canadians rightly expect fairness and accountability in the full range of government institutions that serve them. Our Government will reintroduce legislation to restore fair representation in the House of Commons. It will take steps to phase out direct taxpayer subsidies to federal political parties over the next three years. It will support transparency for First Nations communities by requiring their chiefs and councillors to publish their salaries and expenses. Our Government will also support the efforts of the Public Service to modernize the way it works so that it can continue to provide the highest standard of service to Canadians.
In filling the two upcoming vacancies on the Supreme Court of Canada, our Government will engage parliamentarians through the transparent process first used in 2006.
Our Government will also ensure that citizens, the private sector and other partners have improved access to the workings of government through open data, open information and open dialogue.
Conclusion
As Canadians, we take pride in our history and look forward to our future as the true North, strong and free. From our earliest days, we have always come together to advance our common purpose, each of us ready to do our part to move Canada forward.
Building on the careful investments and decisive actions of the past five years, our Government will move swiftly to deliver the next important phase of the Economic Action Plan. Our Government will reflect the courage Canadians show in meeting the challenges of today and their determination to rise to those they see on the horizon.
Members of the House of Commons, you will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Senators and Members of the House of Commons, let the work of our great democracy support Canadians as they go about fashioning a twenty-first century destiny limited only by their ambition and imagination.
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations and make you equal to the trust bestowed upon you."
50,41,2,2013-10-16,conservative,"Honourable Senators,
Members of the House of Commons,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Let us begin this day together by honouring in silent reflection those whose lives were tragically taken at Lac- Mégantic.
I come before you today as one proud Canadian among a vast nation of these, sincere in congratulation on this opening day of the Second Session of the Forty-first Parliament of Canada. I bear the happy wishes and deep affection of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, whose family has this year been blessed with the birth of Prince George.
Parliamentarians, you gather today with the high confidence and higher expectation of Canadians. Remember that our nation has embraced a unique set of indelible qualities that must guide your deliberations in this Parliament.
Consider this: we are inclusive. We are 35 million people gathered from every part of the world. We welcome the contribution of all those who inhabit this land - from the first of us to the latest among us. This year, we celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Royal Proclamation. This extraordinary document is part of the legal foundation of our country. It recognized the rights of Aboriginal people in Canada for the first time and established the basis of their relations with the Crown.
Consider this: we are honourable. People of peace, we use our military power sparingly; but when we do so we do so with full conviction, gathering our forces as men and women who believe that the freedoms we enjoy cannot be taken from us. This clarity focuses our might in terrible times. And wherever and whenever we unleash that might, we raise our grateful voices and our prayers to honour those who have stood in harm's way for us.
Consider this: we are selfless. Our survival has been sustained by humility and acceptance of our mutual interdependence. Giving lies in our very nature, certain in our hearts that none but the gift passed from an open hand will multiply as those we help better themselves, those they love and, at length, the country they call home.
Consider this: we are smart. We deplore self-satisfaction, yearning rather for self-improvement. We love learning and cherish our right to it. We are united, prosperous and free precisely because we ensure that Canadians have opportunities to learn, excel, advance, and thus to contribute.
Consider this: we are caring. Our abiding concern for the common good of our neighbours - in each community - makes us responsive. We do not abandon our fellows to scrape by in times of distress or natural disaster. Inspired by our common bond, we come swiftly and resiliently to the aid of those in need.
Today, as we contemplate our 150th anniversary, the eyes and ears and expectations of Canadians turn toward this Parliament, in trust that those who stand here in their place will relentlessly advance and uphold ideas that are inclusive, honourable, selfless, smart and caring at every turn without fail.
Let us not disappoint. And with that spirit and direction, let us turn now to the present.
Two and a half years ago, Canadians gave our Government a strong mandate: a mandate to protect jobs and our economy; a mandate to keep taxes low; a mandate to make our families and communities safe.
Despite ongoing uncertainty and instability from beyond our shores, our Government remains focused on these priorities. We made tough choices - the right choices for Canadian families. The results are clear: more Canadians have good jobs than ever before; families are paying lower taxes; our financial house is in order.
As the world looks to recovery, a rare opportunity now lies before us as Canadians: the opportunity to build on our ingenuity, our immense natural wealth, and our values and stability; the opportunity to secure the future, for our generation, and our children's generation. It is the opportunity to lead the world in security and prosperity - not for the sake of doing so, but so that Canadian families who work hard, pay their taxes and play by the rules can get ahead.
This is Canada's moment; together we will seize it.
And as we do, we draw inspiration from our founders, leaders of courage and audacity. Nearly 150 years ago, they looked beyond narrow self-interest. They faced down incredible challenges - geographic, military, and economic. They were undaunted. They dared to seize the moment that history offered. Pioneers, then few in number, reached across a vast continent. They forged an independent country where none would have otherwise existed.
In the words of Thomas D'Arcy McGee:
""I see in the not remote distance one great nationality bound, like the shield of Achilles, by the blue rim of ocean. I see it quartered into many communities, each disposing of its internal affairs, but all bound together by free institutions...''
With hard work, sacrifice and common sense, those Canadian men and women built this country. In so doing, they founded a constitutional democracy, among the most enduring history has known. As we look to the 150th anniversary of our Confederation, we are reminded that ours is a rich inheritance: a legacy of freedom; the birthright of all humanity and the courage to uphold it; the rule of law, and the institutions to protect it; respect for human dignity and diversity.
Guided by these values, we Canadians - Aboriginal, French, English, people from all corners of the globe - strive together for our families and a brighter future. We are on the cusp of a moment that is uniquely Canada's.
Just as our founders dared, so too must we.
We must seize this moment to secure prosperity, for Canadians now, and the generations to follow.
1. Creating Jobs and Opportunities for Canadians
Balanced Budgets and Reducing the Cost of Government
Creating jobs and securing economic growth is and will remain our Government's top priority.
When disaster struck the world economy, our Government's decisive and pragmatic leadership navigated Canada through the worst global recession in a generation.
Even before the recession hit, our Government was prepared. It maintained budget surpluses and paid down billions from the national debt. It lowered taxes for Canadians and job-creating businesses.
During the downturn, our Government's Economic Action Plan took the steps necessary to safeguard our economy. It protected Canadian jobs. It invested in infrastructure and productivity. And it controlled spending, while maintaining growing transfers that support health care, education and retirement.
In spite of continuing risks from beyond our shores, our Government is leading the world by example. It secured the commitment of the world's largest economies to put in place credible plans to achieve financial sustainability. And it set clear targets to bring our own deficit down. Canada now leads the G-7 - in job creation; in income growth; and in keeping debt levels low.
Canada is now among only a few countries in the world with a triple-A credit rating.
By taking decisive action Canada has stayed strong where others have faltered. But we cannot be complacent. The global economy still faces significant risks from factors that we do not control. We must stay the course. And sound management remains our Government's guide.
Canadian families know they cannot prosper by continually spending more than they earn. Our Government is no different.
    Last year's deficit was less than forecast. Our Government will balance the budget by 2015.
    And it will go further. Our Government will enshrine in law its successful and prudent approach. Our Government will introduce balanced-budget legislation. It will require balanced budgets during normal economic times, and concrete timelines for returning to balance in the event of an economic crisis.
    Our Government has already set an ambitious debt-to-GDP target of 25 per cent by 2021. And it will reduce that ratio to pre-recession levels by 2017.
Just as our Government manages debt, so too is it tackling spending. Every day, Canadian families make tough choices about how to spend their hard-earned money. Guided by this example, our Government will continue reducing the size and cost of Government to ensure that taxpayers get value for money.
    Our Government will freeze the overall federal operating budget, which will continue to restrain hiring.
    Our Government will make further targeted reductions to internal government spending.
    Our Government will reform the way the federal system manages spending.
    Our Government will review federal assets; when it is in the best interest of Canadians, they will be sold.
    Our Government recognizes the value of a lean, competent and committed public service. Public Service pay and benefit levels will be reasonable, responsible, and in the public interest.
    Our Government has already reformed federal government pension plans, to ensure that parliamentarians and public servants pay their fair share. It will reform disability and sick-day entitlements and work with employees to get them back to work as soon as possible.
    Our Government will amend the Public Service Labour Relations Act to ensure that the Public Service is affordable, modern and high-performing.
    Our Government will increase performance accountability in the Public Service to provide better service to Canadians, at a reduced cost, and to better recognize dedicated and effective employees.
    And we will make government more efficient and responsive to Canadians - by, for example, moving from 63 different email systems to one.
Jobs for Canadians
Canadians want good, well-paying, stable jobs. And our country needs Canadians working.
Canadians know that businesses create jobs. So our Government lowered their tax burden and cut red tape.
Canada now has the best job creation record in the G-7 - one million net new jobs since the depths of the recession. These are overwhelmingly full-time, well-paying, private sector jobs.
But our Government is not stopping here.
Canada has one of the best-educated workforces in the world. But there are too many people without jobs and too many jobs without people.
    To address this job creation gap, our Government is implementing the Canada Job Grant. It will increase employment by ensuring Canadians are able to fill job vacancies.
    Our Government will take further steps to see that those traditionally under-represented in the workforce, including people with disabilities, youth, and Aboriginal Canadians, find the job-training they need.
    Our Government will work with provinces and territories on a new generation of labour market agreements to more effectively connect Canadians with disabilities to employers and in-demand jobs.
    Canada's youth unemployment rate is already much lower than many advanced countries. But it remains too high. Our Government will redirect federal investments in youth employment to provide real-life work experience in high-demand fields.
    Our Government recognizes the tremendous potential of Canada's First Nations, Métis and Inuit populations to strengthen the growing Canadian economy. It will continue working with First Nations to develop stronger, more effective, and more accountable on-reserve education systems.
    In a dynamic economy, workers must be able to use their skills, wherever in Canada they choose to work. Provincial borders should not be employment barriers. Our Government will work with provinces and territories to improve credential recognition and enable the free movement of skilled workers.
    Our Government will ensure that Canadians are aware of the opportunities offered by the skilled trades, and will assist apprentices with the cost of their training.
    Our Government will complete reforms to the Temporary Foreign Worker Program to ensure that Canadians always have the first chance at available jobs.
    And our Government will continue to create the conditions for new and better jobs for Canadians across all sectors of our economy.
Trade
From the days of the coureurs des bois and the Hudson's Bay Company, Canada has been a trading nation. Today, with one in five Canadian jobs dependent on exports, our prosperity hinges on opening new markets for Canadian goods, services and investment.
This is why our Government launched the most ambitious trade agenda in Canadian history. In less than seven years, Canada has concluded new free-trade agreements with nine countries and our Government is negotiating further agreements involving more than 60 others.
    The Government will soon complete negotiations on a comprehensive economic and trade agreement with the European Union. This agreement has the potential to create 80,000 new Canadian jobs.
    Our Government is also committed to expanding trade with emerging markets in Asia and the Americas through our engagement in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and active negotiations with Japan, South Korea, and India.
    To further promote the success of Canadian exporters, our Government will launch a comprehensive new plan to assist Canadian businesses as they expand abroad.
    The United States remains Canada's biggest and best customer. Our Government will continue implementing the Beyond the Border and Regulatory Cooperation Action Plans to speed the flow of people, goods and services between our two countries.
    Here at home, our Government will continue to work to remove barriers to trade between provinces and territories that cost jobs, inconvenience Canadians, and defy common sense. For instance, our Government will work with British Columbia and Ontario, and other willing jurisdictions, to set up a cooperative regulatory system for securities and capital markets.
    And our Government will amend the Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act to allow Canadians to take beer and spirits across provincial boundaries for their own use.
Resource Development
Since Canada's earliest days, our economy has been built on our abundant natural resources. Directly and indirectly, the natural resource sector employs 1.8 million Canadians, many in skilled, high-paying jobs. Resource development generates 30 billion dollars annually in revenue that supports health care, education and programs Canadians cherish.
Canada's energy reserves are vast - sufficient to fuel our growing economy and supply international customers for generations to come. However, for Canadians to benefit fully from our natural resources we must be able to sell them. A lack of key infrastructure threatens to strand these resources at a time when global demand for Canadian energy is soaring.
We must seize this moment. The window for gaining access to new markets will not remain open indefinitely. Now more than ever, our future prosperity depends on responsible development of these resources. At the same time, our Government has taken action to ensure that Canada's resources do not fall under foreign government control.
    Our Government will continue to ensure that our natural resource sectors remain open to foreign investment when it is market-oriented and in the long-term interests of Canadians.
    Canada's natural wealth is our national inheritance and our Government will ensure that the jobs and opportunities it brings are available to all Canadians. In particular, Canada's Aboriginal peoples must have every opportunity to benefit.
Our Government believes, and Canadians expect, that resource development must respect the environment. Our Government's plan for responsible resource development includes measures to protect against spills and other risks to the environment and local communities. Our Government will:
    Enshrine the polluter-pay system into law;
    Set higher safety standards for companies operating offshore as well as those operating pipelines, and increase the required liability insurance;
    Re-introduce the Safeguarding Canada's Seas and Skies Act, to protect our oceans and coasts; and
    Act on advice from the Expert Panel on Tanker Safety, to create a world-class tanker safety system in Canada.
Farms, Fisheries, Forestry
Canada was built on the work of farmers, fishermen, and foresters. They work hard to feed our families and sustain rural communities.
Our Government will continue to protect and promote Canada's traditional industries.
    Our Government has given farmers marketing freedom and is helping them adapt and innovate. It will continue to develop new markets around the world for Canadian products, while supporting supply management.
    Our Government has supported fishermen by ensuring proper management of fish stocks and by opening new markets worldwide. It will continue to be open to solutions, supported by fishermen, that strengthen the economic competitiveness of this traditional pillar of our coastal economy.
    Forestry remains essential to Canada's rural economy, supporting almost 200,000 jobs across the country. Our Government secured and extended the softwood lumber agreement with the United States. And our Government will continue to support innovation and pursue new export opportunities for Canadian companies.
Infrastructure
Infrastructure investment creates jobs, supports trade, drives productivity and contributes in a fundamental way to growth and long-term prosperity.
For Canadians balancing the pressures of work and daily life, investment in our roads, bridges and transportation networks means less congestion, shorter commutes and more time with family. That's why, in Economic Action Plan 2013, our Government launched the new Building Canada Plan, the largest long-term federal commitment to infrastructure in Canadian history.
    Over the next decade, our Government will invest 70 billion dollars in federal, provincial, territorial and community infrastructure. Projects such as building subways in the Greater Toronto Area, replacing Montréal's Champlain Bridge, building a new Windsor-Detroit crossing and constructing Vancouver's Evergreen Line will create jobs across our country.
Shipbuilding and Manufacturing
    Our Government will work in partnership with industry to ensure that all major military purchases create high-quality jobs for Canadian workers. Our Government's National Shipbuilding Plan will create 15,000 well-paying, skilled jobs over 30 years for Canadians and produce much-needed new ships for the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Coast Guard.
    Canada's automotive and aerospace industries are also key parts of our economy. That's why our Government renewed the Automotive Innovation Fund and improved the Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative. Both have a proven track record of generating results for Canadians - jobs, prosperity and increased foreign investment.
    To foster Canadian productivity and global competitiveness, our Government provided 1.4 billion dollars in tax relief to manufacturing companies investing in modern machinery and equipment. And our new Advanced Manufacturing Fund will support new products and production methods.
Science and Technology
Our Government's leadership in science and technology helps Canadian business remain competitive while creating high-paying jobs. Since 2006, our Government has invested more than 9 billion dollars to support science, technology and innovative companies operating at the outer limits of knowledge.
Canada now leads G-7 countries in post-secondary research investment.
    Transformation of the National Research Council, doubling the Industrial Research Assistance Program, and the new Venture Capital Action Plan are all helping to promote greater commercialization of research and development.
    Building on this strong foundation, our Government will release an updated Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy.
    Our Government will continue making targeted investments in science and innovation chains from laboratory to market in order to position Canada as a leader in the knowledge economy.
    And our Government will continue to promote Canada as a world-class destination for international students.
Small Business and Tourism
Canada's spectacular beauty attracts visitors from across the globe to every region of our country. These visitors create jobs and sustain local economies. Our Government will continue to work with industry partners to promote Canada as a top destination for tourism.
Our Government has reduced the red tape burden on small and medium-sized businesses. There are now fewer regulations and the cost of red tape has been reduced by nearly 20 million dollars annually.
    Our Government will introduce legislation to enshrine the One-for-One Rule in law: for every new regulation added, one must be removed.
    The Canada Revenue Agency will cut additional red tape and help businesses navigate the tax system.
    And, following our Government's return to balanced budgets, it will look at ways to provide further tax relief to job-creating small businesses.
2. Supporting and Protecting Canadian Families
Keeping Taxes Low
Canadians work hard for their money. And we know families are better placed to make spending decisions than governments. That is why our Government has lowered taxes, year after year - for families, for businesses, for each and every Canadian.
For example, our Government:
    Cut the GST, from seven to six to five per cent;
    Created Tax Free Savings Accounts, which now benefit more than eight million Canadians;
    Established a 5,000-dollar tax credit for first-time home buyers;
    Reduced the lowest personal income tax rate and increased the basic personal exemption;
    Introduced income splitting for seniors;
    Brought in arts and fitness tax credits for our children; and
    Froze Employment Insurance premiums for the next three years, meaning that employees and employers will save 660 million dollars next year alone.
Overall, the federal tax burden is at its lowest level in half a century. As a result of our Government's low-tax plan, the average Canadian family now pays 3,200 dollars less in taxes every year. Our Government has a proven record of cutting taxes for Canadian families. We have delivered on our promises. And, once the budget is balanced, our Government is committed to greater tax relief for Canadian families.
Defending Canadian Consumers
Canadian families work hard to make ends meet, and every dollar counts. While companies will look out for their bottom line, our Government is looking out for everyday Canadians.
When Canadians make decisions about how to spend their money, they must be assured of a voice, a choice, and fair treatment. For example, although Canadians are among the most digitally connected in the world, we also pay some of the highest wireless rates in the developed world. As families know - especially families with teenagers - the monthly bills add up.
Our Government has already taken action to achieve greater competition. Canadians know that competition is good for everyone. Competition lowers prices and keeps businesses from becoming complacent. As a result, wireless rates have fallen nearly 20 per cent since 2008.
But there is much more work to do.
    Our Government will take steps to reduce roaming costs on networks within Canada.
    Our Government believes Canadian families should be able to choose the combination of television channels they want. It will require channels to be unbundled, while protecting Canadian jobs.
    Our Government will continue enhancing high-speed broadband networks for rural Canadians.
And our Government will take additional action to protect Canadian consumers. Canadians are tired of hidden fees. They deserve to know the real cost of paying by debit or credit card. And they should not be charged more in Canada for identical goods that sell for less in the United States.
Our Government will:
    End ""pay to pay'' policies, so customers won't pay extra to receive paper bills;
    Expand no-cost basic banking services;
    Work with the provinces and territories to crack down on predatory payday lenders;
    Empower consumers by requiring disclosure of the cost of different payment methods; and
    Take further action to end geographic price discrimination against Canadians.
Supporting Victims and Punishing Criminals
Our Government believes that the justice system exists to protect law-abiding citizens and our communities. For too long, the voices of victims have been silenced, while the system coddled criminals. Our Government has worked to re- establish Canada as a country where those who break the law are punished for their actions; where penalties match the severity of crimes committed; where the rights of victims come before the rights of criminals.
    Our Government will introduce a Victims Bill of Rights to restore victims to their rightful place at the heart of our justice system.
    Our Government will focus on protecting the most vulnerable of all victims, our children. Recent tragic deaths, including those of Amanda Todd, Rehtaeh Parsons, and Todd Loik, have shocked Canadians. Our Government will introduce legislation giving police and prosecutors new tools to effectively address cyberbullying that involves criminal invasion of privacy, intimidation and personal abuse. This legislation would create a new criminal offence prohibiting the non-consensual distribution of intimate images.
    Canadians are rightfully alarmed when violent offenders found not criminally responsible for their actions are released into our communities. Our Government will re-introduce legislation to ensure that public safety comes first.
    But we must do even more to protect our children. Child predators should never be let off with only a single sentence for multiple crimes against children. Canadians demand that those who prey on our children pay the full price for every devastated life. Our Government will end sentencing discounts for child sex offenders.
    It is also unacceptable that dangerous and violent offenders are released into our communities before serving their full sentences. Our Government will end the practice of automatic early release for serious repeat offenders.
    But for the worst of all criminals, even this is not enough. Canadians do not understand why the most dangerous criminals would ever be released from prison. For them, our Government will change the law so that a life sentence means a sentence for life.
    Aboriginal women are disproportionately the victims of violent crime. Our Government will renew its efforts to address the issue of missing and murdered Aboriginal women.
    Canadians also know that prostitution victimizes women and threatens the safety of our communities. Our Government will vigorously defend the constitutionality of Canada's prostitution laws.
    Finally, our Government recognizes the daily risks taken by police officers and their service animals. It will bring forward Quanto's law in honour of them.
Safeguarding Families and Communities
Families are the cornerstone of our society. Families raise our children and build our communities. As our families succeed, Canada succeeds.
Our Government understands the daily pressures ordinary Canadian families face. And it is working to strengthen families, not replace them. That's why our Government took money from bureaucrats and lobbyists and gave it to the real experts on child care - mom and dad. Our Government's Universal Child Care Benefit provides 1,200 dollars a year to parents to help with the costs of raising kids.
Our Government will also support hard-working Canadian families in other ways.
    Every day, parents make choices about what goes on the dinner table. Our Safe Food for Canadians Act was a significant milestone in strengthening Canada's world-class food safety system. Our Government will work with the provinces and territories to further strengthen food inspection regimes.
    Our Government will consult with Canadian parents to improve the way nutritional information is presented on food labels.
    Our Government is also committed to ensuring that drug labels are written in plain language, and that the potential side effects of medication are accurately indicated. To help identify potentially dangerous drugs, and ensure the quick recall of unsafe drugs, it will introduce new patient safety legislation. This will include new powers to require reporting of adverse drug reactions.
Our Government will also:
    Build on our caregiver tax credit by working with employers to better accommodate Canadians caring for older family members;
    Help seniors quickly access information about programs and services they need and use in their communities;
    Make adoption more affordable for Canadian families;
    Renew investments in health research to tackle the growing onset of dementia, and related illnesses;
    Prevent employers and insurance companies from discriminating against Canadians on the basis of genetic testing;
    Collaborate with injury prevention organizations, to reduce the injury rate in Canada; and
    Work with the provinces and territories and with the private and not-for-profit sectors to encourage young Canadians to be more physically active.
Canadian families expect safe and healthy communities in which to raise their children. They want to address poverty and other persistent social problems, access safe and reliable infrastructure, and enjoy a clean and healthy environment.
Our Government will:
    Re-introduce and pass the Respect for Communities Act to ensure that parents have a say before drug injection sites open in their communities;
    Expand its National Anti-Drug Strategy to address the growing problem of prescription drug abuse;
    Close loopholes that allow for the feeding of addiction under the guise of treatment;
    Act on the opportunities presented by social finance and the successful National Call for Concepts for Social Finance;
    Build on the successful Housing First approach and its renewed Homelessness Partnering Strategy to help house vulnerable Canadians;
    Protect Canada's rich natural heritage by unveiling a new National Conservation Plan to further increase protected areas, focusing on stronger marine and coastal conservation;
    Complete, by 2015, its work to protect wilderness lands in Nááts'ihch'oh, Bathurst Island and the Mealy Mountains;
    Work with communities, non-profit organizations, and businesses to create and protect more green space in our urban and suburban areas;
    Take further action to improve air quality nationwide; and
    Build on its record as the first government to achieve an absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by working with provinces to reduce emissions from the oil and gas sectors while ensuring Canadian companies remain competitive.
Since before Confederation, Canada has relied on railways for the movement of goods and passengers. It is no different today. New economic opportunities still require rail to link Canadian goods to waiting markets.
    Our Government has already amended the Railway Safety Act to further enhance the safety of rail transportation.
    As efforts to clean up and rebuild Lac-Mégantic demonstrate, railway companies must be able to bear the cost of their actions. Our Government will require shippers and railways to carry additional insurance so they are held accountable.
    And we will take targeted action to increase the safety of the transportation of dangerous goods.
The first responders and ordinary Canadians who came together to confront the recent disasters in Lac-Mégantic and Alberta showed courage under the most dire circumstances. The Government has always stood with communities in times of crisis and recovery.
    Our Government will continue to support the citizens of Lac-Mégantic and affected communities in Alberta as they move forward.
    Building community resilience can mitigate the worst impacts of natural disasters and other emergencies before they happen. Our Government will work with provinces and territories to develop a National Disaster Mitigation Program, focused on reducing the impact of natural disasters.
3. Putting Canada First
Supporting Our Armed Forces
Government has no higher obligation than the protection of national sovereignty and the security of citizens. And Canadians know that you cannot earn respect by projecting weakness. Serious countries have serious capabilities.
Look at the paintings that adorn this room - scenes of the Great War. They remind us of this, and of the profound sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform. These heroes are the pride of our country and the backbone of our history.
After a decade of darkness, our Government has been living up to our promise to give the Canadian military the tools it needs to get the job done. Soldier for soldier, sailor for sailor, airman for airman, the Canadian Armed Forces are once again the best in the world.
No longer does Canada have to hitch a ride with our allies. Our serving men and women can now carry out their vital missions. The Royal Canadian Air Force is flying new heavy-lift C-17 and C-130J transport aircraft, and operating Chinook helicopters. New tanks, artillery and other equipment have proven their worth in combat. Canadian workers at Canadian shipyards will build new ships for the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Coast Guard. And our Government will complete our plan to replace Canada's fleet of fighter jets.
Building on these successes, our Government will renew our Canada First Defence Strategy. Now and in the future, Canada's Armed Forces will defend Canada and protect our borders; maintain sovereignty over our Northern lands and waters; fight alongside our allies to defend our interests; and respond to emergencies within Canada and around the world.
To be effective, our military must have more teeth and less tail. Our Government will:
    Put front-line capability before back-office bureaucracy;
    Respond to emerging threats to our sovereignty and economy posed by terrorism and cyber-attacks, while ensuring Canadians' fundamental privacy rights are protected;
    Incorporate a strong role for our military reserves, who are an essential link between the Armed Forces and Canadian communities; and
    Assist employers of reservists who are required to deploy on missions vital to the security of all Canadians.
As our Government takes these steps, it will always keep faith with those who have defended Canada with pride. Our veterans have stood up for us; we will stand by them. Our Government has made unprecedented investments to support our veterans.
Our Government has:
    Increased support through its enhanced Veterans Charter;
    Ensured dignified funerals for our injured veterans;
    Reduced red tape so veterans can access the benefits they need; and
    Invested almost five billion additional dollars in benefits and programs.
Our Government has worked to help returning veterans re-establish themselves. We will:
    Reach out to homeless veterans and help give them the support they need; and
    Build on our successful ""Helmets to Hardhats'' program to place veterans in good jobs.
Canada's Northern Sovereignty
We are a northern country. We are a northern people. Canada's greatest dreams are to be found in our highest latitudes. They are the dreams of a North confident and prosperous, the True North, strong and free.
Our Government is securing our Northern sovereignty; promoting prosperity for Northerners; protecting our Arctic environmental heritage; and giving the people of the North a greater say in their own affairs.
Our Government has made great strides by:
    Opening the Canadian Armed Forces Arctic Training Centre;
    Expanding the Canadian Rangers, our eyes and ears in the North;
    Creating the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency;
    Mapping Canada's Arctic seabed to assert our sovereignty;
    Investing in health care, education, and affordable housing for Northerners; and
    Concluding a historic Devolution Agreement with the Northwest Territories and negotiating one with Nunavut.
But the eyes of the world increasingly look enviously to our North. Our Government will not rest.
    Our Government will fulfill Prime Minister Diefenbaker's historic vision by completing the Dempster Highway to the Arctic Ocean, linking Canada from sea to sea to sea.
    Our Government has established the Canadian High Arctic Research Station. This world-class science and technology research facility will open in time for the 150th anniversary of Confederation.
    With the arrival of our Government's new Arctic Offshore Patrol Ships, Canada's first deep water Arctic port at Nanisivik will be operational.
    Our Government recognizes that the future prosperity of the North requires responsible development of its abundant natural resources. Northerners must benefit from this treasure. Our Government will work alongside Inuit, First Nations, territorial governments and industry to ensure that Northerners are well trained to take their full place in this new economy.
    Our Government will also continue to defend the seal hunt, an important source of food and income for coastal and Inuit communities.
    The story of the North is the story of Canada. In order to tell that story for Canada's 150th year, our Government will continue efforts to solve one of the most enduring mysteries of our past. We will work with renewed determination and an expanded team of partners to discover the fate of Sir John Franklin's lost Arctic expedition.
Promoting Canadian Values
Canada stands for what is right and good in the world. This is the true character of Canadians - honourable in our dealings, faithful to our commitments, loyal to our friends. Confident partners, courageous warriors and compassionate neighbours.
Canada does not go along to get along. Our Government defends Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, the lone outpost of freedom and democracy in a dangerous region. And our Government stands opposed to those regimes that threaten their neighbours, slaughter their citizens, and imperil freedom. These regimes must ultimately be judged not by their words, but by their actions.
Canada seeks a world where freedom - including freedom of religion, the rule of law, democracy and human dignity are respected. Our Government will continue to promote these fundamental values around the world, including through the newly established Office of Religious Freedom.
And Canadians know that freedom and prosperity march together.
    Our Government will help the world's neediest by partnering with the private sector to create economic growth in the developing world.
    Tax dollars spent on foreign aid must achieve real results. Our Government's international aid will continue to be focused, effective and accountable.
Canadians also know that free and healthy societies require the full participation of women. Canada has taken a leadership role in addressing the health challenges facing women, infants and children in the world's poorest countries. These efforts are saving millions of lives.
    In particular, Canada recognizes the courageous and inspiring example set by Malala Yousafzai in risking her life promoting education for young women. She faced down evil and oppression and now speaks boldly for those who are silenced. Recognizing her heroism, our Government will, on behalf of all Canadians, bestow honorary citizenship on this remarkable young woman.
    Sadly, millions of women and girls continue to be brutalized by violence, including through the inhumane practice of early and forced marriage. This barbarism is unacceptable to Canadians. Our Government will take steps to ensure that it does not occur on our soil.
It is the reality of our country that Canadians of very different origins live and work side by side, together. New Canadians work hard to learn our languages, our values, and our traditions, and in turn, are welcomed as equal members of the Canadian family. Our Government inherited a broken immigration system, and has worked hard to fix it.
Our Government has:
    Cut the backlog of applications by almost half;
    Eliminated the backlog for economic immigrants;
    Cut the right-of-landing fee in half;
    Lowered wait times for skilled workers coming to Canada;
    Increased protection for genuine refugees;
    Reduced the number of fraudulent asylum claimants and deported more than 100,000 illegal immigrants; and
    Remained on track to meet our goal of reuniting families faster.
But there is still more our Government can and will do.
    We know that a job is the best path to social integration. Our Government will introduce a new model to select immigrants based on the skills Canadian employers need.
    Our Government will reform the Immigrant Investor Program so that these investors make a real contribution in exchange for the security and pathway to citizenship that Canada provides.
Canadians understand that citizenship should not be simply a passport of convenience. Citizenship is a pledge of mutual responsibility and a shared commitment to values rooted in our history.
    Our Government will not hesitate to uphold the fundamental rights of all Canadians wherever they are threatened.
    To strengthen and protect the value of Canadian citizenship, our Government will introduce the first comprehensive reforms to the Citizenship Act in more than a generation.
2017: Anniversary of Confederation
As we look confidently to the future, we draw great strength from our past. Beginning with our Aboriginal peoples, Canada's story is one of risk, sacrifice, and rugged determination. From the founding of New France, to the fight for Canada in the War of 1812; from the visionary achievement of Confederation, to our victory at Vimy Ridge, Canadians have repeatedly triumphed over long odds to forge a great country, united and free.
It is a story we recall with wonder and recount with pride. A story of how different provinces founded a federation in which our distinct strengths advance our unity. A federation in which Canada's two national languages position us uniquely in the world; where francophones thrive and celebrate a unique culture, in solidarity with fellow Canadians.
Our Government has recognized the Québécois as a nation within a united Canada. It will work with the Government of Québec to ensure our common prosperity. And our Government will continue to respect the division of jurisdiction at the heart of the Constitution adopted at Confederation.
Canada's Confederation is worth celebrating. As we approach our historic 150th anniversary in 2017, our Government will join with Canadians in honouring this momentous milestone by:
    Marking the 150th anniversaries of the Charlottetown and Québec Conferences;
    Celebrating the 200th birthdays of two of our greatest Fathers of Confederation, Sir George-Étienne Cartier and Sir John A. Macdonald;
    Commemorating the centennial of the First World War and the 75th anniversary of the Second World War, and the enormous sacrifices made by Canadians and our Allies in both;
    Re-dedicating the National War Memorial to the memory of all men and women who fought for our country;
    Building a Memorial to the Victims of Communism, to remember the millions who suffered under tyranny;
    Marking the end of Canada's mission in Afghanistan by honouring the service of our men and women in uniform, including those who made the ultimate sacrifice combating the spread of terrorism;
    Honouring the proud history of our Canadian Armed Forces by restoring military traditions;
    Strengthening the Cadet and Junior Ranger programs;
    Establishing the Canadian Museum of History to share the story of Canada with pride;
    Supporting the Pan and Parapan American Games and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2015, showcasing Canadians' proud, competitive and united spirit under the maple leaf; and
    Working with Canadians to support community projects, local celebrations, and other initiatives to commemorate this historic occasion.
The coming anniversary of Confederation is also a time to mark the contribution of Canada's First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities, who have had a defining role in shaping our country.
    Our Government will continue our dialogue on the treaty relationship and comprehensive land claims.
    And our Government will continue to work in partnership with Aboriginal peoples to create healthy, prosperous, self-sufficient communities.
The road to 2017 is a fitting time to strengthen our institutions and democratic processes.
    The Government continues to believe the status quo in the Senate of Canada is unacceptable. The Senate must be reformed or, as with its provincial counterparts, vanish. The Government will proceed upon receiving the advice of the Supreme Court.
    And, the Government will propose changes to Canada's elections laws to uphold the integrity of our voting system. Legislation will be introduced in time for implementation prior to the next federal election.
Conclusion
Honourable Members of the Senate and Members of the Commons, as the dawn of our Confederation approached in the 1860s, our founding Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald said of Canada's future that he saw ''a great nation - great in thought, great in action, great in hope, and great in position.''
His vision has come to pass.
Today, Canada is a model for the world. Admired for our freedom. Respected for our principles. Envied for our openness, compassion and peaceful pluralism.
As we approach the 150th anniversary of our great land, we look to the future. A future we will face true to our character, the character of a determined and enterprising people: Canadians, whose shops and small businesses spur the growth of our towns and cities; who work factory shifts and drive taxicabs to help their families get ahead; who take the same pride in raising their children as they do in being citizens of the best country on earth.
These are the quiet, unsung Canadians who are building our country.
It is from them that we draw the inspiration to face an uncertain and unstable world.
It is for them that we will seize the moment before us.
Members of the House of Commons, you will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Senators and Members of the House of Commons, you are the holders of a profound trust reposed in you by Canadians.
May you be equal to that trust in all things and may Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
51,42,1,2015-12-04,liberal,"Honourable Senators,
Members of the House of Commons,
Ladies and gentlemen,
As the representative of Her Majesty The Queen, I am pleased to be here to deliver the Speech from the Throne.
A warm welcome to those of you who are returning to your duties as parliamentarians, including those who are returning after an absence.  Know that your experience is valued.
Welcome also to the 197 members who are newly elected.  Your enthusiasm and fresh ideas will serve your country well.
I call on all parliamentarians to work together, with a renewed spirit of innovation, openness and collaboration.
As governor general, I have seen first-hand what a great country Canada is—from coast to coast to coast.
And I also know this: We can be even better.
How?
By being smart, and caring—on a scale as never before.
The times we live in demand nothing less.
Canada succeeds in large part because here, diverse perspectives and different opinions are celebrated, not silenced.
Parliament shall be no exception.
In this Parliament, all members will be honoured, respected and heard, wherever they sit.  For here, in these chambers, the voices of all Canadians matter.
Let us not forget, however, that Canadians have been clear and unambiguous in their desire for real change.  Canadians want their government to do different things, and to do things differently.
They want to be able to trust their government.
And they want leadership that is focused on the things that matter most to them.
Things like growing the economy; creating jobs; strengthening the middle class, and helping those working hard to join it.
Through careful consideration and respectful conduct, the Government can meet these challenges, and all others brought before it.
By working together in the service of all Canadians, the Government can make real change happen.
It will do so in the following ways.
Growth for the middle class
First and foremost, the Government believes that all Canadians should have a real and fair chance to succeed.  Central to that success is a strong and growing middle class.
The Government will, as an immediate priority, deliver a tax cut for the middle class.
This is the fair thing to do, and the smart thing to do for Canada’s economy.
The Government has also committed to provide more direct help to those who need it by giving less to those who do not.  The new Canada Child Benefit will do just that.
And recognizing that public investment is needed to create and support economic growth, job creation and economic prosperity, the Government will make significant new investments in public transit, green infrastructure, and social infrastructure.
To give Canadians a more secure retirement, the Government will work with the provinces and territories to enhance the Canada Pension Plan.
The Employment Insurance system will be strengthened to make sure that it best serves both the Canadian economy and all Canadians who need it.
To create more opportunities for young Canadians, especially those from low- and
middle-income families, the Government will work with the provinces and territories to make post-secondary education more affordable.
And to support the health and well-being of all Canadians, the Government will begin work with the provinces and territories to develop a new Health Accord.
The Government will undertake these and other initiatives while pursuing a fiscal plan that is responsible, transparent and suited to challenging economic times.
Open and transparent government
Second, the Government is committed to open and transparent government.
The trust Canadians have in public institutions—including Parliament—has, at times, been compromised. By working with greater openness and transparency, Parliament can restore it.
To make sure that every vote counts, the Government will undertake consultations on electoral reform, and will take action to ensure that 2015 will be the last federal election conducted under the first-past-the-post voting system.
To restore public trust and bring an end to partisanship, the Government will follow through on its commitment to reform the Senate by creating a new, non-partisan, merit-based process to advise the Prime Minister on Senate appointments.
And to give Canadians a stronger voice in the House of Commons, the Government will promote more open debate and free votes, and reform and strengthen committees.
Also notable are the things the Government will not do: it will not use government ads for partisan purposes; it will not interfere with the work of parliamentary officers; and it will not resort to devices like prorogation and omnibus bills to avoid scrutiny.
A clean environment and a strong economy
Third, the Government will prove to Canadians and to the world that a clean environment and a strong economy go hand in hand.  We cannot have one without the other.
Protecting the environment and growing the economy are not incompatible goals; in fact, our future success demands that we do both.
Last week, first ministers met ahead of the international climate change talks—a first step in an important and ongoing process.
Working together, the Government will continue to provide leadership as Canada works toward putting a price on carbon and reducing carbon pollution.
To encourage economic growth, the Government will make strategic investments in clean technology, provide more support for companies seeking to export those technologies, and lead by example in their use.
And as part of efforts to restore public trust, the Government will introduce new environmental assessment processes.
Public input will be sought and considered.  Environmental impacts will be understood and minimized.  Decisions will be informed by scientific evidence.  And Indigenous peoples will be more fully engaged in reviewing and monitoring major resource development projects.
Diversity is Canada’s strength
Fourth, the Government’s agenda reflects that Canada’s strength is its diversity.
Canadians elected a government to bring us together, not to set us against one another.  Canada is strong because of our differences, not in spite of them.
As a country, we are strengthened in many ways: by our shared experiences, by the diversity that inspires both Canada and the world, and by the way that we treat each other.
Because it is both the right thing to do and a certain path to economic growth, the Government will undertake to renew, nation-to-nation, the relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples, one based on recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership.
Among other measures, the Government will work co-operatively to implement recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, will launch an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, and will work with First Nations so that every First Nations child receives a quality education.
The Government will make it easier for immigrants to build successful lives in Canada, reunite their families, and contribute to the economic success of all Canadians.
In response to a pressing international need, and underscored by Canadians’ desire to help, the Government will welcome 25,000 new Canadians from Syria, to arrive in Canada by the end of February 2016.
In gratitude for the service of Canada’s veterans, the Government will do more to support them and their families.
The Government will support CBC/Radio-Canada, encourage and promote the use of Canada’s official languages, and invest in Canada’s cultural and creative industries.
Security and opportunity
Fifth, the Government is committed to providing greater security and opportunity for Canadians.
Canadians are open, accepting, and generous people.  We know that helping those in need strengthens our communities and makes them safer, more prosperous places to live.
The Government will strengthen its relationship with allies, especially with our closest friend and partner, the United States.
Internationally, the Government will focus its development assistance on helping the world’s poorest and most vulnerable.
To contribute to greater peace throughout the world, the Government will renew Canada’s commitment to United Nations peacekeeping operations, and will continue to work with its allies in the fight against terrorism.
To keep Canadians safe and be ready to respond when needed, the Government will launch an open and transparent process to review existing defence capabilities, and will invest in building a leaner, more agile, better-equipped military.
And to expand economic opportunities for all Canadians, the Government will negotiate beneficial trade agreements, and pursue other opportunities with emerging markets.
Recognizing that Canada is, fundamentally, a safe and peaceful country, the Government will continue to work to keep all Canadians safe, while at the same time protecting our cherished rights and freedoms.
To that end, the Government will introduce legislation that will provide greater support for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault; that will get handguns and assault weapons off our streets; and that will legalize, regulate and restrict access to marijuana.
Conclusion
The agenda outlined today is an ambitious one, but it is not one forged in isolation.
Rather, it is the result of conversations with Canadians, who told the Government—plainly and honestly—what they need to be successful.
Canadians are confident people.  We know who we are, and we know what kind of country we want to live in.
We know the greatness that Canada is capable of, and we know that our success is not only about doing well for ourselves, but also about leaving an even better, more peaceful and prosperous world for our children.
As you consider the important work that lies ahead, remember that Canadians have placed their trust in you.  It is now your sacred responsibility to help build that better world.
By focusing on growing our middle class, on delivering open and transparent government, on ensuring a clean environment and a strong economy, on building a stronger Canada, and on providing greater security and opportunity, the Government will make real change happen.
It will prove that better is not only possible—it is the inevitable result when Canadians work together.
Members of the House of Commons, you will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate and Members of the House of Commons, may Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations and make you faithful custodians of the trust bestowed upon you."
