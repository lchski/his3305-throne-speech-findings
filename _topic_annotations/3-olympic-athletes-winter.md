This is [what I call an “event” topic](/discussion/#types-of-topics). It appears in only one speech, that of March 3, 2010—delivered just days following the end of what was a very successful Olympic games for Canada, hosted in Canada itself. Reading that speech, there appear to be three sections of that document that are represented to this topic, referring to the Olympics.

Event topics like these are not particularly surprising for those with general knowledge of the subject under study. However, if someone came to this corpus _without_ knowing that the Olympics had been held in Canada that year, an anomalous topic like this would be a good hint that something of potential interest had happened around the time of that speech.
