This is an excellent example of [an “author” topic](/discussion/#types-of-topics): these words reflect one specific party trying to carve out a sort of political niche for themselves. This topic appears almost exclusively in speeches delivered by the Harper Conservatives, and appears in almost every one of their speeches; the Liberal government of 2015 did not continue with this language. These words paint a particular vision of Canada—a heavy emphasis on `families`, combined with an interest in the North and the Arctic, in `sovereignty` and `freedom`.
