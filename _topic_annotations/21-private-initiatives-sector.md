This topic appears to be the combination of two [issue topics](/discussion/#types-of-topics). One of the issues seems to concern the role of the private sector in the economy (`private`, `initiatives`, `sector`), while the other seems to refer to the various constitutional negotiations from the 1970s on (`rights`, `individual`, `unity`).

Similar to [topic 6, “Social policy”](/topics/6-health-communities-children/), this demonstrates one of the difficulties (or opportunities) of topic modelling: topics can appear to mix together discrete concepts. Further research, though, might find that these apparently discrete topics are in fact related, that the constitutional negotiations were somehow linked to the private sector’s role in the economy, though this does not appear as an intuitive conclusion.
