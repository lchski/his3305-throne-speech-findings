This topic appears to be [an issue topic](/discussion/#types-of-topics). Generally, mentions of `economy`, `women`, and `environment` increase from the mid-1980s on.

This topic prompted me to dig a bit further into the question of “environment” as an issue, and mentions of “women”:

* Digging into [`environ*` with Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=f03e42475d31eda15315cb9227e53586&stopList=keywords-8b435bead5253b011f8d10e58eec0d8c&panels=corpusterms,reader,trends,summary,contexts&query=environ*), I found that early speeches often spoke of the environment either in connection with the economy (“economic environment”) or as a place for relaxation (in connection with National Parks, for example). The speech with the most mentions of the term (Parliament 34, session 2) was delivered in April 1989 by a Conservative government. By this point, the sense had shifted to environmental protection and regulation, in part in connection with the 1987 Montreal Protocol on ozone protection.
* A Voyant search for `women|woman|girls|girl|female` (linking to Voyant for this search breaks the tool) reveals that mentions of women shift from a more general sense early in the corpus, referring to their status generally and working toward equality, to more specific senses in more recent years, calling out specific groups (e.g., Indigenous women, women in uniform, girls in developing countries).
