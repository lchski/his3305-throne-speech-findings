        This is the full list of thirty topics generated from the corpus. For each, I have included:
        the automatic “label” for the topic (the top eight words); a plot showing the weights of the
        top ten words in the topic; and a plot showing the weight of the topic in each of the speeches
        from the corpus.
    </p>

    <p>
       Some points to note in interpreting the plots:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                The x-axis for the top ten word weights is not consistent from topic to topic, while the
                y-axis for the topic’s weight in each speech <em>is</em> consistent from topic to topic. The latter
                thus allows comparing between topics, while the former is presented more for interest’s sake.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The bars in the speech plots are colour-coded by the governing party that wrote the speech: red for the Liberals,
                blue for the Conservatives.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                At the bottom of many of the speech plots, you’ll see that many of the red or blue dots representing speeches are faded.
                This means that that topic is not present within that speech.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
