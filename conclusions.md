title: Conclusions, project implications, next steps
---

My main conclusions about the project’s guiding question are noted in the [discussion section](/discussion/). Here, I explore what the project taught me about using topic modelling, about speeches from the throne as a corpus, and about the combination of the two for the study of government priorities. I also expand on some potential next steps.

## What can we learn about...

### ...topic modelling?

Topics like [#24](/topics/24-act-asked-provide/) reveal the great potential of topic modelling. Admittedly, it is not a particularly relevant topic to this project’s overall question. But it suggested an entirely new path of research—thanks to topic modelling, I was better able to think through the corpus and understand its possibilities for research.

### ...speeches from the throne?

They do offer a decent corpus for analyzing priorities. We were able to observe, for example, the [rise in interest in social policy as a broad issue area](/topics/6-health-communities-children/). That said, they are not an exhaustive listing of a government’s priorities, and many more nuanced or niche issues may not have been picked up by the topic modeller.

That said, the topic modeller would have been more effective with a larger corpus. 158,000 words and 51 documents is relatively small for topic modelling. It may have been more fruitful to use a corpus like yearly budget speeches, and to expand the years under analysis. However, for the purposes of this small project, speeches from the throne worked well enough.

### ...government priorities?

Ultimately, the topics generated did not surface too many “issue” topics. Given the constraints of topic modelling, noted above, this is not necessarily a surprise.

The approach taken by Montpetit and Foucault (CITEME 2012), tagging portions of sentences with specific policy issues, would be more effective at exhaustively identifying the priorities discussed by governments in speeches from the throne. However, such an approach may not have yielded the alternative conclusions suggested by topic modelling, and it would have taken far more time.

Nonetheless, we were able to observe various trends, as noted in [the discussion section](/discussion/). While this corpus and tool could not provide an extremely detailed portrait of such trends, it was certainly able to point to some shifts.

## Next steps

This work suggested a variety of paths for future research:

* check the formality topic with speeches by the GG outside of Parliament, and by the PM, to get “institutional” and “political” comparisons (topic 24)
* ability to use these topics on other corpora
* share the code! reproducibility, etc.
*
